        description: PromotionPolicy provides fine-grained access control beyond what
          Kubernetes RBAC is capable of. A PromotionPolicy names an Environment and
          enumerates subjects (such as users, groups, ServiceAccounts, or RBAC Roles)
          that are authorized to create Promotions for that Environment. It is through
          PromotionPolicies that multiple users may be permitted to create Promotion
          resources in a given namespace, but creation of Promotion resources for
          specific Environments may be restricted.

              can automatically be promoted into the Environment referenced by the
              Environment field. Note: There are other conditions also required for
              an auto-promotion to occur. Specifically, there must be a single source
              of new EnvironmentStates, so regardless of the value of this field,
              an auto-promotion could never occur for an Environment subscribed to
              MULTIPLE upstream environments. This field defaults to false, but is
              commonly set to true for Environments that subscribe to repositories
              instead of other, upstream Environments. This allows users to define
              Environments that are automatically updated as soon as new materials
              are detected.'
