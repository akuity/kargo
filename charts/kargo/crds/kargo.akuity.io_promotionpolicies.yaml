              be promoted into the Stage referenced by the Stage field. Note: There
              are other conditions also required for an auto-promotion to occur. Specifically,
              there must be a single source of new Freight, so regardless of the value
              of this field, an auto-promotion could never occur for a Stage subscribed
              to MULTIPLE upstream Stages. This field defaults to false, but is commonly
              set to true for Stages that subscribe to repositories instead of other,
              upstream Stages. This allows users to define Stages that are automatically
              updated as soon as new materials are detected.'
