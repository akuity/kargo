## @section KubeConfigs
## @descriptionStart
## Optionally point to Kubernetes Secrets containing kubeconfig for:
##
## 1. A remote cluster hosting Kargo resources
##
## 2. A remote cluster hosting Argo CD resources
##
## 3. A remote cluster that is running Argo Rollouts and is a suitable location
##    to execute user-defined verification processes in the form of Argo
##    Rollouts AnalysisRuns
##
## This flexibility is useful for various advanced use cases -- especially
## topologies where Kargo data may be sharded, with Kargo controllers distributed
## across many clusters. Any two, or even all three, of these configurations may
## be the same. In the average case, these should all be left unspecified. All
## that are unspecified will default to configuration for the cluster in which
## the Kargo controller is running.
## @descriptionEnd

  probes:
    ## @param api.probes.enabled Whether liveness and readiness probes should be included in the API server deployment. It is sometimes advantageous to disable these during local development.
    enabled: true

  tls:
    ## @param api.tls.enabled Whether to enable TLS directly on the API server. This is helpful if you do not intend to use an ingress controller or if you require TLS end-to-end. All other settings in this section will be ignored when this is set to `false`.
    enabled: true
    ## @param api.tls.selfSignedCert Whether to generate a self-signed certificate for use by the API server. If `true`, `cert-manager` CRDs **must** be present in the cluster. Kargo will create and use its own namespaced issuer. If `false`, a cert secret named `kargo-api-cert` **must** be provided in the same namespace as Kargo.
    selfSignedCert: true

  ## @param api.enablePermissiveCORSPolicy Whether to enable a permissive CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) policy. This is sometimes advantageous during local development, but otherwise, should generally be left disabled.
  enablePermissiveCORSPolicy: false

  ingress:

    enabled: false
    ## @param api.ingress.annotations Annotations specified by your ingress controller to customize the behavior of the ingress resource.
    annotations: {}
      # kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    ## @param api.ingress.ingressClassName From Kubernetes 1.18+, this field is supported if implemented by your ingress controller. When set, you do not need to add the ingress class as annotation.
    ingressClassName:
    tls:
      ## @param api.ingress.tls.enabled Whether to enable TLS for the ingress. All other settings in this section will be ignored when this is set to `false`.
      enabled: true
      ## @param api.ingress.tls.selfSignedCert Whether to generate a self-signed certificate for use with the API server's Ingress resource. If `true`, `cert-manager` CRDs **must** be present in the cluster. Kargo will create and use its own namespaced issuer. If `false`, a cert secret named `kargo-api-ingress-cert` **must** be provided in the same namespace as Kargo.
      selfSignedCert: true
    ## @param api.ingress.pathType You may want to use `Prefix` for some controllers (like AWS LoadBalancer Ingress controller), which don't support `/` as wildcard path when pathType is set to `ImplementationSpecific`
    pathType: ImplementationSpecific

  service:
    ## @param api.service.type If you're not going to use an ingress controller, you may want to change this value to `LoadBalancer` for production deployments. If running locally, you may want to change it to `NodePort` OR leave it as `ClusterIP` and use `kubectl port-forward` to map a port on the local network interface to the service.
    type: ClusterIP
    ## @param api.service.nodePort [nullable] Host port the `Service` will be mapped to when `type` is either `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`. If not specified, Kubernetes chooses.
    # nodePort:
    ## @param api.service.annotations Annotations to add to the API server's service. Merges with `global.annotations`, allowing you to override or add to the global annotations.
    annotations: {}

  secret:
    ## @param api.secret.name Specifies the name of an existing Secret which contains the `ADMIN_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_HASH` and `ADMIN_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY` values. By setting this, the Secret will **not** be generated by Helm.
    name: ""

  adminAccount:
    ## @param api.adminAccount.enabled Whether to enable the admin account.
    enabled: true
    ## @param api.adminAccount.passwordHash Bcrypt password hash for the admin account. A value **must** be provided for this field unless `api.secret.name` is specified.
    passwordHash: ""
    ## @param api.adminAccount.tokenSigningKey Key used to sign ID tokens (JWTs) for the admin account. It is suggested that you generate this using a password manager or a command like: `openssl rand -base64 29 \| tr -d "=+/" \| cut`. A value **must** be provided for this field, unless `api.secret.name` is specified.
    tokenSigningKey: ""
    ## @param api.adminAccount.tokenTTL Specifies how long ID tokens for the admin account are valid. (i.e. The expiry will be the time of issue plus this duration.)
    tokenTTL: 24h

  ## All settings related to enabling OpenID Connect as an authentication
  ## method.
  oidc:
    ## @param api.oidc.enabled Whether to enable authentication using Open ID Connect.
    ## NOTE: Kargo uses the Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) and does not require a client secret. Some OIDC identity providers may not support this. If yours does not, enabling the optional Dex server and configuring its connectors can adapt most identity providers to work this way.
    ## Note also: The PKCE code challenge used by Kargo is SHA256 hashed.
    ## For more information about PKCE, please visit: https://oauth.net/2/pkce/
    enabled: false
    ## @param api.oidc.issuerURL The issuer URL for the identity provider. If Dex is enabled, this value will be ignored and the issuer URL will be automatically configured. If Dex is not enabled, this should be set to the issuer URL provided to you by your identity provider.
    issuerURL:
    ## @param api.oidc.clientID The client ID for the OIDC client. If Dex is enabled, this value will be ignored and the client ID will be automatically configured. If Dex is not enabled, this should be set to the client ID provided to you by your identity provider.
    clientID:
    ## @param api.oidc.cliClientID The client ID for the OIDC client used by CLI (optional). Needed by some OIDC providers (such as Dex) that require a separate Client ID for web app login vs. CLI login (`http://localhost`). If Dex is enabled, this value will be ignored and cli client ID will be automatically configured. If Dex is not enabled, and a different client app is configured for localhost CLI login, this should be the client ID configured in the IdP.
    cliClientID:

    admins:
      ## @param api.oidc.admins.subs Subjects having any of these values in their sub claim will automatically be Kargo admins.

    dex:
      ## @param api.oidc.dex.enabled Whether to enable Dex as the identity provider. When set to true, the Kargo installation will include a Dex server and the Kargo API server will be configured to make the /dex endpoint a reverse proxy for the Dex server.
      enabled: false

      image:
        ## @param api.oidc.dex.image.repository Image repository of Dex

Kargo will create and use its own namespaced issuer. If `false`, a cert secret named `kargo-dex-server-cert` **must** be provided in the same namespace as Kargo. There is no provision for running Dex without TLS.
        selfSignedCert: true
      ## @param api.oidc.dex.skipApprovalScreen Whether to skip Dex's own approval screen. Since upstream identity providers will already request user consent, this second approval screen from Dex can be both superfluous and confusing.
      skipApprovalScreen: true
      ## @param api.oidc.dex.connectors Configure [Dex connectors](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/) to one or more upstream identity providers.
      connectors: []
      # - id: mock

  ## All settings relating to the use of Argo Rollouts by the API Server.
  rollouts:
    ## @param api.rollouts.integrationEnabled Specifies whether Argo Rollouts integration is enabled. When not enabled, the API server will not be capable of creating/updating/applying AnalysesTemplate resources in the Kargo control plane. When enabled, the API server will perform a sanity check at startup. If Argo Rollouts CRDs are not found, the API server will proceed as if this integration had been explicitly disabled. Explicitly disabling is still preferable if this integration is not desired, as it will grant fewer permissions to the API server.
    integrationEnabled: true

## @section Controller
## All settings for the controller component
controller:
  ## @param controller.enabled Whether the controller is enabled.
  enabled: true

  ## All settings relating to shared credentials (used across multiple kargo projects)
  globalCredentials:
    ## @param controller.globalCredentials.namespaces List of namespaces to look for shared credentials.
    namespaces: []

  gitClient:
    ## @param controller.gitClient.name Specifies the name of the Kargo controller (used when authoring Git commits).
    name: "Kargo Render"
    ## @param controller.gitClient.email Specifies the email of the Kargo controller (used when authoring Git commits).
    email: "kargo-render@akuity.io"

    signingKeySecret:
      ## @param controller.gitClient.signingKeySecret.name Specifies the name of an existing `Secret` which contains the Git user's signing key. The value should be accessible under `.data.signingKey` in the same namespace as Kargo. When the signing key is a GPG key, the GPG key's name and email address identity must match the values defined for `controller.gitClient.name` and `controller.gitClient.email`.
      name: ""
      ## @param controller.gitClient.signingKeySecret.type Specifies the type of the signing key. The currently supported and default option is `gpg`.
      type: ""

  ## @param controller.securityContext Security context for controller pods. Defaults to `global.securityContext`.
  securityContext: {}

  ## @param controller.shardName [nullable] Set a shard name only if you are running multiple controllers backed by a single underlying control plane. Setting a shard name will cause this controller to operate **only** on resources with a matching shard name. Leaving the shard name undefined will designate this controller as the default controller that is responsible exclusively for resources that are **not** assigned to a specific shard. Leaving this undefined is the correct choice when you are not using sharding at all. It is also the correct setting if you are using sharding and want to designate a controller as the default for handling resources not assigned to a specific shard. In most cases, this setting should simply be left alone.
  # shardName:

  ## All settings relating to the Argo CD control plane this controller might
  ## integrate with.
  argocd:
    ## @param controller.argocd.integrationEnabled Specifies whether Argo CD integration is enabled. When not enabled, the controller will not watch Argo CD Application resources or factor Application health and sync state into determinations of Stage health. Argo CD-based promotion mechanisms will also fail. When enabled, the controller will perform a sanity check at startup. If Argo CD CRDs are not found, the controller will proceed as if this integration had been explicitly disabled. Explicitly disabling is still preferable if this integration is not desired, as it will grant fewer permissions to the controller.
    integrationEnabled: true
    ## @param controller.argocd.namespace The namespace into which Argo CD is installed.
    namespace: argocd
    ## @param controller.argocd.watchArgocdNamespaceOnly Specifies whether the reconciler that watches Argo CD Applications for the sake of forcing related Stages to reconcile should only watch Argo CD Application resources residing in Argo CD's own namespace. Note: Older versions of Argo CD only supported Argo CD Application resources in Argo CD's own namespace, but newer versions support Argo CD Application resources in any namespace. This should usually be left as `false`.
    watchArgocdNamespaceOnly: false

  ## All settings relating to the use of Argo Rollouts AnalysisTemplates and
  ## AnalysisRuns as a means of verifying Stages after a Promotion.
  rollouts:
    ## @param controller.rollouts.integrationEnabled Specifies whether Argo Rollouts integration is enabled. When not enabled, the controller will not reconcile Argo Rollouts AnalysisRun resources and attempts to verify Stages via Analysis will fail. When enabled, the controller will perform a sanity check at startup. If Argo Rollouts CRDs are not found, the controller will proceed as if this integration had been explicitly disabled. Explicitly disabling is still preferable if this integration is not desired, as it will grant fewer permissions to the controller.
    integrationEnabled: true
    ## @param controller.rollouts.controllerInstanceID Specifies a cluster on which Jobs corresponding to an AnalysisRun (used for Freight/Stage verification purposes) will be executed. This is useful in cases where the cluster hosting the Kargo control plane is not a suitable environment for executing user-defined logic. Kargo will use this as the value of the rgo-rollouts.argoproj.io/controller-instance-id label when creating AnalysisRuns. When this is left empty/undefined, no such label will be added to AnalysisRuns.
    controllerInstanceID: ""

## @section Garbage Collector
garbageCollector:
  ## @param garbageCollector.enabled Whether the garbage collector is enabled.
  enabled: true
  ## @param garbageCollector.schedule When to run the garbage collector.
  schedule: "0 * * * *"
  ## @param garbageCollector.workers The number of concurrent workers to run. Tuning this too low will result in slow garbage collection. Tuning this too high will result in too many API calls and may result in throttling.
  workers: 3
  ## @param garbageCollector.maxRetainedPromotions The ideal maximum number of Promotions OLDER than the oldest Promotion in a non-terminal phase (for each Stage) that may be spared by the garbage collector. The ACTUAL number of older Promotions spared may exceed this ideal if some Promotions that would otherwise be deleted do not meet the minimum age criterion.
  maxRetainedPromotions: 20
  ## @param garbageCollector.minPromotionDeletionAge The minimum age a Promotion must be before considered eligible for garbage collection.
  minPromotionDeletionAge: 336h # Two weeks
  ## @param garbageCollector.maxRetainedFreight The ideal maximum number of Freight OLDER than the oldest still in use (from each Warehouse) that may be spared by the garbage collector. The ACTUAL number of older Freight spared may exceed this ideal if some Freight that would otherwise be deleted do not meet the minimum age criterion.
  maxRetainedFreight: 20
  ## @param garbageCollector.minFreightDeletionAge The minimum age Freight must be before considered eligible for garbage collection.
  minFreightDeletionAge: 336h # Two weeks
  ## @param garbageCollector.logLevel The log level for the garbage collector.
