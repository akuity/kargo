rbac:
  ## Indicates whether relevant cluster-scoped roles should be installed/updated
  ## by this chart. Set to false if this is NOT the first install of Kargo in
  ## a given cluster, otherwise this chart will attempt to create resources that
  ## already exist. You may also wish to set this to false if you are installing
  ## Kargo into one cluster, but configuring it to manage a DIFFERENT cluster.
  ## In that case, you should use the kargo-kit chart to install these resources
  ## in the Kargo-managed cluster.
  installClusterRoles: true
  ## Indicates whether relevant ClusterRoleBindings should be installed/updated
  ## by this chart. You may wish to set this to false if you are installing

## Optionally point to a Kubernetes Secret in the same namespace as Kargo that

## This is a useful method of hosting Kargo in one cluster, but having it manage
## Environments, Promotions, Argo CD Applications, etc. that live in a second
## cluster. Note that CRDs, ValidatingWebhookConfigurations, and
## MutatingWebhookConfigurations will need to be installed manually into the
## cluster Kargo will be managing. This can be accomplished using the kargo-kit
## chart.
