  ## Indicates whether relevant cluster-scoped roles should be installed/updated
  ## by this chart. Set to false if this is NOT the first install of Kargo in
  ## a given cluster, otherwise this chart will attempt to create resources that
  ## already exist. You may also wish to set this to false if you are installing
  ## Kargo into one cluster, but configuring it to manage a DIFFERENT cluster.
  ## In that case, you should use the kargo-kit chart to install these resources
  ## in the Kargo-managed cluster.
