                  This is an optional field as it is sometimes useful to aggregates available
                  Freight from multiple upstream Stages without performing any actions. The
                  utility of this is to allow multiple downstream Stages to subscribe to a
                  single upstream Stage where they may otherwise have subscribed to multiple
                  upstream Stages.
