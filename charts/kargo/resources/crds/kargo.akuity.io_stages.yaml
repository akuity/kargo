                                    one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also 0), the effective
                                    default will be the system-wide default of 1.

                                    A value of 1 will cause the Promotion to be marked as failed after just
                                    a single failure; i.e. no retries will be attempted.

                                    There is no option to specify an infinite number of retries using a value

                                    In a future release, Kargo is likely to become capable of distinguishing
                                    between recoverable and non-recoverable step failures. At that time, it is
                                    planned that unrecoverable failures will not be subject to this threshold
                                    and will immediately cause the Promotion to be marked as failed without
                                    further condition.

                                    Timeout is the soft maximum interval in which a step that returns a Running
                                    status (which typically indicates it's waiting for something to happen)
                                    may be retried.

                                    The maximum is a soft one because the check for whether the interval has
                                    elapsed occurs AFTER the step has run. This effectively means a step may
                                    run ONCE beyond the close of the interval.

                                    If this field is set to nil, the effective default will be a step-specific
                                    one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also nil), the effective
                                    default will be the system-wide default of 0.

                                    A value of 0 will cause the step to be retried indefinitely unless the
                                    ErrorThreshold is reached.
