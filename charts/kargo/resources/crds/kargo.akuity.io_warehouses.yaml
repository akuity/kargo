                              tag. Useful when tags embed a leading date or timestamp. The AllowTags
                              and IgnoreTags fields can optionally be used to narrow the set of tags
                              eligible for selection.

                            - "NewestBuild": Selects the image that was most recently pushed to the

                              AllowTags and IgnoreTags fields can optionally be used to narrow the set
