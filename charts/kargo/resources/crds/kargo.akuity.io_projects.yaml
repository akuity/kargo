                        AutoPromotionEnabled indicates whether new Freight can automatically be

                        be other conditions also required for an auto-promotion to occur. This
                        field defaults to false, but is commonly set to true for Stages that
                        subscribe to Warehouses instead of other, upstream Stages. This allows
                        users to define Stages that are automatically updated as soon as new
                        artifacts are detected.
