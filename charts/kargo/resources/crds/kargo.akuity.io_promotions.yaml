                            ErrorThreshold is the number of consecutive times the step must fail (for

                            as failed.

                            If this field is set to 0, the effective default will be a step-specific
                            one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also 0), the effective
                            default will be the system-wide default of 1.

                            A value of 1 will cause the Promotion to be marked as failed after just
                            a single failure; i.e. no retries will be attempted.

                            There is no option to specify an infinite number of retries using a value
                            such as -1.

                            In a future release, Kargo is likely to become capable of distinguishing
                            between recoverable and non-recoverable step failures. At that time, it is
                            planned that unrecoverable failures will not be subject to this threshold
                            and will immediately cause the Promotion to be marked as failed without
                            further condition.

                        timeout:
                          description: |-
                            Timeout is the soft maximum interval in which a step that returns a Running
                            status (which typically indicates it's waiting for something to happen)
                            may be retried.

                            The maximum is a soft one because the check for whether the interval has
                            elapsed occurs AFTER the step has run. This effectively means a step may
                            run ONCE beyond the close of the interval.

                            If this field is set to nil, the effective default will be a step-specific
                            one. If no step-specific default exists (i.e. is also nil), the effective
                            default will be the system-wide default of 0.

                            A value of 0 will cause the step to be retried indefinitely unless the
                            ErrorThreshold is reached.
