                          Phase describes the current phase of the Verification process. Generally,
                          this will be a reflection of the underlying AnalysisRun's phase, however,
                          there are exceptions to this, such as in the case where an AnalysisRun
                          cannot be launched successfully.

                  LastHandledRefresh holds the value of the most recent AnnotationKeyRefresh
                  annotation that was handled by the controller. This field can be used to
                  determine whether the request to refresh the resource has been handled.

                  Message is a display message about the promotion, including any errors
                  preventing the Promotion controller from executing this Promotion.
                  i.e. If the Phase field has a value of Failed, this field can be expected
                  to explain why.
