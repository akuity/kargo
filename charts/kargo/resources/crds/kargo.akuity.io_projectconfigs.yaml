                        be other conditions also required for an auto-promotion to occur. This

                        subscribe to Warehouses instead of other, upstream Stages. This allows
                        users to define Stages that are automatically updated as soon as new
                        artifacts are detected.

                              A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that

                            map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the

                            Name is the name of the resource to which this policy applies.

                            It can be an exact name, a regex pattern (with prefix "regex:"), or a
                            glob pattern (with prefix "glob:").

                            When both Name and LabelSelector are specified, the Name is ANDed with
                            the LabelSelector. I.e., the resource must match both the Name and
                            LabelSelector to be selected by this policy.

                            NOTE: Using a specific exact name is the most secure option. Pattern
                            matching via regex or glob can be exploited by users with permissions to
                            match promotion policies that weren't intended to apply to their
                            resources. For example, a user could create a resource with a name
                            deliberately crafted to match the pattern, potentially bypassing intended
                            promotion controls.
