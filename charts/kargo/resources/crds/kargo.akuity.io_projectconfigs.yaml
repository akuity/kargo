                            promotion controls.

                            For cluster-scoped webhook receivers, the referenced Secret must be in the
                            designated "cluster Secrets" namespace.

                            The Secret's data map is expected to contain a `secret` key whose value
                            does NOT need to be shared directly with Quay when registering a
                            webhook. It is used only by Kargo to create a complex, hard-to-guess URL,
                            which implicitly serves as a shared secret. For more information about
                            Quay webhooks, please refer to the Quay documentation:
