              Alias is a human-friendly alias for a piece of Freight. This is an optional
              field. A defaulting webhook will sync this field with the value of the
              kargo.akuity.io/alias label. When the alias label is not present or differs
              from the value of this field, the defaulting webhook will set the label to
              the value of this field. If the alias label is present and this field is
              empty, the defaulting webhook will set the value of this field to the value
              of the alias label. If this field is empty and the alias label is not
              present, the defaulting webhook will choose an available alias and assign
              it to both the field and label.

                    the chart within the repository. In the case of a repository within an OCI
                    registry, the URL implicitly points to a specific chart and the Name field
