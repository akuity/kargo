                            VirtualRepoName is the name of an Artifactory virtual repository.

                            When unspecified, the Artifactory webhook receiver depends on the value of
                            the webhook payload's `data.repo_key` field when inferring the URL of the
                            repository from which the webhook originated, which will always be an
                            Artifactory "local repository." In cases where a Warehouse subscribes to
                            such a repository indirectly via a "virtual repository," there will be a
                            discrepancy between the inferred (local) repository URL and the URL
                            actually used by the subscription, which can prevent the receiver from
                            identifying such a Warehouse as one in need of refreshing. When specified,
                            the value of the VirtualRepoName field supersedes the value of the webhook
                            payload's `data.repo_key` field to compensate for that discrepancy.

                            In practice, when using virtual repositories, a separate Artifactory
                            webhook receiver should be configured for each, but one such receiver can
                            handle inbound webhooks from any number of local repositories that are
                            aggregated by that virtual repository. For example, if a virtual repository
                            `proj-virtual` aggregates container images from all of the `proj`
                            Artifactory project's local image repositories, with a single webhook
                            configured to post to a single receiver configured for the `proj-virtual`
                            virtual repository, an image pushed to
                            `example.frog.io/proj-<local-repo-name>/<path>/image`, will cause that
                            receiver to refresh all Warehouses subscribed to
                            `example.frog.io/proj-virtual/<path>/image`.
