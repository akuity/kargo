### KubeConfigs

Optionally point to Kubernetes Secrets containing kubeconfig for:

1. A remote cluster hosting Kargo resources

2. A remote cluster hosting Argo CD resources

3. A remote cluster that is running Argo Rollouts and is a suitable location
to execute user-defined verification processes in the form of Argo
Rollouts AnalysisRuns

This flexibility is useful for various advanced use cases -- especially
topologies where Kargo data may be sharded, with Kargo controllers distributed
across many clusters. Any two, or even all three, of these configurations may
be the same. In the average case, these should all be left unspecified. All
that are unspecified will default to configuration for the cluster in which
the Kargo controller is running.

| `api.tls.selfSignedCert`                    | Whether to generate a self-signed certificate for use by the API server. If `true`, `cert-manager` CRDs **must** be present in the cluster. Kargo will create and use its own namespaced issuer. If `false`, a cert secret named `kargo-api-cert` **must** be provided in the same namespace as Kargo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `true`                   |
| `api.enablePermissiveCORSPolicy`            | Whether to enable a permissive CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) policy. This is sometimes advantageous during local development, but otherwise, should generally be left disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `false`                  |
| `api.ingress.enabled`                       | Whether to enable ingress. By default, this is disabled. Enabling ingress is advanced usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `false`                  |
| `api.ingress.annotations`                   | Annotations specified by your ingress controller to customize the behavior of the ingress resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `nil`                    |
| `api.ingress.ingressClassName`              | From Kubernetes 1.18+, this field is supported if implemented by your ingress controller. When set, you do not need to add the ingress class as annotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `nil`                    |
| `api.ingress.tls.enabled`                   | Whether to enable TLS for the ingress. All other settings in this section will be ignored when this is set to `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `true`                   |
| `api.ingress.tls.selfSignedCert`            | Whether to generate a self-signed certificate for use with the API server's Ingress resource. If `true`, `cert-manager` CRDs **must** be present in the cluster. Kargo will create and use its own namespaced issuer. If `false`, a cert secret named `kargo-api-ingress-cert` **must** be provided in the same namespace as Kargo.                                                                                                                                                                                             | `true`                   |
| `api.ingress.pathType`                      | You may want to use `Prefix` for some controllers (like AWS LoadBalancer Ingress controller), which don't support `/` as wildcard path when pathType is set to `ImplementationSpecific`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `ImplementationSpecific` |
| `api.service.type`                          | If you're not going to use an ingress controller, you may want to change this value to `LoadBalancer` for production deployments. If running locally, you may want to change it to `NodePort` OR leave it as `ClusterIP` and use `kubectl port-forward` to map a port on the local network interface to the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `ClusterIP`              |
| `api.service.nodePort`                      | Host port the `Service` will be mapped to when `type` is either `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`. If not specified, Kubernetes chooses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `undefined`              |
| `api.secret.name`                           | Specifies the name of an existing Secret which contains the `ADMIN_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_HASH` and `ADMIN_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY` values. By setting this, the Secret will **not** be generated by Helm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `""`                     |

| `api.adminAccount.passwordHash`             | Bcrypt password hash for the admin account. If specified, will ignore `password`. A value **must** be provided for either this field or `password`, unless `api.secret.name` is specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `""`                     |
| `api.adminAccount.password`                 | A password for the admin account. Ignored if `passwordHash` is set. It is suggested that you generate this using a password manager or a command like: `openssl rand -base64 29 \| tr -d "=+/" \| cut -c1-25`. A value **must** be provided for either this field or `passwordHash`, unless `api.secret.name` is specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `""`                     |
| `api.adminAccount.tokenSigningKey`          | Key used to sign ID tokens (JWTs) for the admin account. It is suggested that you generate this using a password manager or a command like: `openssl rand -base64 29 \| tr -d "=+/" \| cut`. A value **must** be provided for this field, unless `api.secret.name` is specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `""`                     |
| `api.adminAccount.tokenTTL`                 | Specifies how long ID tokens for the admin account are valid.

If Dex is not enabled, this should be set to the client ID provided to you by your identity provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `nil`                    |
| `api.oidc.cliClientID`                      | The client ID for the OIDC client used by CLI (optional). Needed by some OIDC providers (such as Dex) that require a separate Client ID for web app login vs. CLI login (`http://localhost`).

| `api.oidc.dex.skipApprovalScreen`           | Whether to skip Dex's own approval screen. Since upstream identity providers will already request user consent, this second approval screen from Dex can be both superfluous and confusing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `true`                   |

| `controller.shardName`                       | Set a shard name only if you are running multiple controllers backed by a single underlying control plane. Setting a shard name will cause this controller to operate **only** on resources with a matching shard name. Leaving the shard name undefined will designate this controller as the default controller that is responsible exclusively for resources that are **not** assigned to a specific shard. Leaving this undefined is the correct choice when you are not using sharding at all. It is also the correct setting if you are using sharding and want to designate a controller as the default for handling resources not assigned to a specific shard. In most cases, this setting should simply be left alone. | `undefined` |
| `controller.argocd.integrationEnabled`       | Specifies whether Argo CD integration is enabled. When not enabled, the controller will not watch Argo CD Application resources or factor Application health and sync state into determinations of Stage health. Argo CD-based promotion mechanisms will also fail. When enabled, the controller will perform a sanity check at startup. If Argo CD CRDs are not found, the controller will proceed as if this integration had been explicitly disabled. Explicitly disabling is still preferable if this integration is not desired, as it will grant fewer permissions to the controller.                                                                                                                                      | `true`      |
| `controller.argocd.namespace`                | The namespace into which Argo CD is installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `argocd`    |
| `controller.argocd.watchArgocdNamespaceOnly` | Specifies whether the reconciler that watches Argo CD Applications for the sake of forcing related Stages to reconcile should only watch Argo CD Application resources residing in Argo CD's own namespace. Note: Older versions of Argo CD only supported Argo CD Application resources in Argo CD's own namespace, but newer versions support Argo CD Application resources in any namespace. This should usually be left as `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `false`     |
| `controller.rollouts.integrationEnabled`     | Specifies whether Argo Rollouts integration is enabled. When not enabled, the controller will not reconcile Argo Rollouts AnalysisRun resources and attempts to verify Stages via Analysis will fail. When enabled, the controller will perform a sanity check at startup. If Argo Rollouts CRDs are not found, the controller will proceed as if this integration had been explicitly disabled. Explicitly disabling is still preferable if this integration is not desired, as it will grant fewer permissions to the controller.                                                                                                                                                                                              | `true`      |
| `controller.rollouts.analysisRunsNamespace`  | Specifies a namespace in which Kargo will create AnalysisRuns (for verification of Stage/Freight). When left empty/unspecified Kargo creates these in project namespaces. In certain topologies, this can compensate for project namespaces not existing in the cluster where Argo Rollouts is running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `""`        |
| `controller.rollouts.controllerInstanceID`   | Specifies a cluster on which Jobs corresponding to an AnalysisRun (used for Freight/Stage verification purposes) will be executed. This is useful in cases where the cluster hosting the Kargo control plane is not a suitable environment for executing user-defined logic. Kargo will use this as the value of the rgo-rollouts.argoproj.io/controller-instance-id label when creating AnalysisRuns. When this is left empty/undefined, no such label will be added to AnalysisRuns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `""`        |

| `garbageCollector.minPromotionDeletionAge` | The minimum age a Promotion must be before considered eligible for garbage collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `336h`      |
| `garbageCollector.maxRetainedFreight`      | The ideal maximum number of Freight OLDER than the oldest still in use (from each Warehouse) that may be spared by the garbage collector. The ACTUAL number of older Freight spared may exceed this ideal if some Freight that would otherwise be deleted do not meet the minimum age criterion.                          | `20`        |
| `garbageCollector.minFreightDeletionAge`   | The minimum age Freight must be before considered eligible for garbage collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `336h`      |
