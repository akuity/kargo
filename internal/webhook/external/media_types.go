// getNormalizedImageRepoURLs returns exactly one or two normalized
// representations of the specified repository URL based on whatever, if
// anything, can be inferred from the specified media type.
//
// In this context, "image repo" could mean a repository in a Docker v2 registry
// OR a repository in an OCI registry. This function assumes that the provided
// repository URL falls into one of those two cases.
//
// Different webhook receivers invoking this function receive and pass on media
// type information of varying degrees of specificity, so no assumptions are
// made about what specific object the specified media type may be associated
// with. The specified media type could reasonably (but non-exhaustively) be
// that of any of the following:
//
//   - A v2 manifest list or an OCI manifest index. These commonly are
//     indicative of a multi-arch container image and imply the specified URL
//     does not reference a chart repository.
//
//   - A v2 or OCI manifest. A v2 manifest is exclusively indicative of a
//     container image and implies the the specified URL references a container
//     image repository. An OCI manifest, however, is more ambiguous and does
//     not imply anything useful about what is referenced by the specified
//     repository URL. That distinction could only be made by examining the
//     mediate type of the config blob.
//
//   - A config blob. If the media type is readily recognizable as Helm-related,
//     it can be inferred that the specified URL references a Helm chart
//     repository. If it's readily recognizable as image-related, it can be
//     inferred that the specified URL references a container image repository.
//
//   - Something entirely unexpected.
//
// If it can be inferred that the repository URL is associated with a container
// image repository, the returned []string will contain only one item -- the
// specified URL normalized as if it represented a container image repository.
//
// If it can be inferred that the repository URL is associated with a Helm chart
// repository, the returned []string will contain only one item -- the specified
// URL normalized as if it represented a Helm chart repository.
//
// In all other cases where it cannot be inferred from the specified media type
// whether the specified URL references a container image repository or a
// Helm chart repository, the returned []string will contain two items -- the
// specified URL normalized both as if it represented a container image
// repository and as if it represented a Helm chart repository. It is
// exclusively the caller's responsibility to deal with this possibility.
