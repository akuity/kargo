Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and application lifecycle
orchestration platform for Kubernetes. It builds upon
[GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) principles and integrates with existing
technologies, like [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/), to streamline and
automate the progressive rollout of changes across the many stages of an
application's lifecycle.

> ⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;Kargo is still undergoing heavy development and is not yet ready
> for production, but all are invited to join us in improving Kargo to help
> it get there.
>
> In the meantime, breaking changes should be anticipated between pre-GA minor
> releases.
