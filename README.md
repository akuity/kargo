K8sTA is a _prototype_ progressive delivery tool built on top of Argo CD for
teams that love Kubernetes and GitOps. By automating away much of the tedium
inherent to GitOps, it is able to orchestrate the rollout of changes through a
series of environments, usually ending with changes reaching production, all
while observing good GitOps practices and maintaining an impeccable paper trail.

> ðŸŸ¡&nbsp;&nbsp;K8sTA is highly experimental at this time and breaking changes
> should be anticipated between pre-GA minor releases.
