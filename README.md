Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and application lifecycle
orchestration platform for Kubernetes. It builds upon
[GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) principles and integrates with existing
technologies, like [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/), to streamline and
automate the progressive rollout of changes across the many stages of an
application's lifecycle.

> to join us in the journey to a GA release (`v1.0.0`)! Please expect breaking changes
> between pre-GA releases (`v0.x.x`).
