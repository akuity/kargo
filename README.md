Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and environment orchestration platform for Kubernetes. 
It builds upon GitOps principles and integrates with existing technologies, like Argo CD, to streamline 
and automate the progressive rollout of changes across multiple environments.

> ⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;Kargo is highly experimental at this time and breaking changes
> should be anticipated between pre-GA minor releases.
