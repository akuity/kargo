# Signing Commits

All commits merged into Kargo's main branch MUST bear a DCO (Developer
Certificate of Origin) sign-off. This is a line placed at the end of a commit
message containing a contributor’s “signature.” In adding this, the contributor
certifies that they have the right to contribute the material in question.

Here are the steps to sign your work:

1. Verify the contribution in your commit complies with the
   [terms of the DCO](https://developercertificate.org/).

1. Add a line like the following to your commit message:

   ```
   Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>
   ```

   You MUST use your legal name -- handles or other pseudonyms are not
   permitted.

   While you could manually add DCO sign-off to every commit, there is an easier
   way:

   1. Configure your git client appropriately. This is one-time setup.

      ```shell
      git config user.name <legal name>
      git config user.email <email address you use for GitHub>
      ```

      If you work on multiple projects that require a DCO sign-off, you can
      configure your git client to use these settings globally instead of only
      for Kargo:

      ```shell
      git config --global user.name <legal name>
      git config --global user.email <email address you use for GitHub>
      ```

   1. Use the --signoff or -s (lowercase) flag when making each commit. For
      example:

      ```shell
      git commit --message "<commit message>" --signoff
      ```

      If you ever make a commit and forget to use the `--signoff` flag, you can
      amend your commit with this information before pushing:

      ```shell
      git commit --amend --signoff
      ```

   1. You can verify the above worked as expected using `git log`. Your latest
      commit should look similar to this one:

      ```shell
      Author: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>
      Date:   Thu Feb 2 11:41:15 2018 -0800

      Update README

      Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>
      ```

      Notice the `Author` and `Signed-off-by` lines match. If they do not, the
      PR will be rejected by the automated DCO check.
