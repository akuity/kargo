## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes}

As announced in our [`v1.1.0` release notes](https://github.com/akuity/kargo/releases/tag/v1.1.0), several deprecated features from _before_ we introduced support for Expression Language have been removed in this release.

- The `fromOrigin` and `fromFreight` fields in the [`argocd-update`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/argocd-update), [`git-clone`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/git-clone/), [`helm-update-chart`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/helm-update-chart/), and [`kustomize-set-image`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/kustomize-set-image/) steps have been removed in favor of the [expression functions](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/expressions#functions).
- The [`kustomize-set-image`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/kustomize-set-image/) step no longer implicitly sets the tag from the Freight image and users must specify either the `tag` or `digest` they wish to set (e.g. using `imageFrom` function).
- The `<thing>FromStep` fields in the [`argocd-update`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/argocd-update), [`git-open-pr`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/git-open-pr/), and [`git-wait-for-pr`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/git-wait-for-pr/) steps have been removed in favor of using [step outputs](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/expressions#pre-defined-variables).
- The `helm-update-image` step has been removed in favor of the more generic [`yaml-update` step](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/yaml-update) which supports the same functionalities.

To discover the new way of providing the configuration for these steps, please refer to the updated documentation examples for each step linked above.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è New Deprecations {#new-deprecations}

Consistent with the changes noted above, the `messageFromSteps` field of the [`git-commit`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/git-commit#configuration) promotion step is newly deprecated in favor of using the `message` field with expressions instead.

`messageFromSteps` is scheduled for removal in the v1.5.0 release.

## ‚ú® New Features {#new-features}

### üîÄ Conditional Step Execution {#conditional-step-execution}

Promotion steps now allow the definition of an [`if` expression](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-templates#conditional-steps) that evaluates to a boolean value. When this [expression](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/expressions) evaluates to `false`, the step is skipped and the next step in the sequence is executed.

```yaml
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Stage
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  # ...
  promotionTemplate:
    spec:
      steps:
      - uses: fake-step
        if: ${{ outputs.step1.someOutput == 'value' }}
```

While the current use cases for this within `Promotion` templates may seem limited, it does allow you to conditionally execute a task step based on provided [task variables](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-tasks#task-variables) in `PromotionTask`s.

In a future release, Kargo will be adding support for improved failure and error handling, which will supercharge this feature based on the outcome of previous steps. Follow [this issue](https://github.com/akuity/kargo/issues/3228) for more information and updates.

### üéõÔ∏è Control of Semantics for Freight Requests {#control-of-semantics-for-freight-requests}

Previously, any requested `Freight` for a `Stage` was automatically available to it as soon as one of the listed upstream `Stage`s had successfully verified it. Starting with this release, and thanks to the efforts of @aidan-canva, it is now possible to define an "availability strategy" that requires it to have been verified in _all_ upstream Stages.

```yaml
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Stage
metadata:
   name: uat
   namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  requestedFreight:
  - origin:
      kind: Warehouse
      name: my-warehouse
    sources:
      stages:
      - test
      - uat
    availabilityStrategy: All
```

Refer to the [updated documentation](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/how-to-guides/working-with-stages#requested-freight) for more information.

### üõ°Ô∏è Stage Verification Improvements {#stage-verification-improvements}

#### Expression Language in Arguments

The values specified in `args` do now support [expressions](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/expressions) (including [functions](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/expressions/#functions)) to dynamically set values based on the context of the `Freight` being verified.

For example, the following defines an argument `commit` with a value set to the commit hash that is being verified using the [`commitFrom` expression function](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/expressions#commitfromrepourl-freightorigin):

```yaml
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Stage
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  # ...
  verification:
    analysisTemplates:
      - name: kargo-demo
    args:
      - name: commit
        value: ${{ commitFrom("https://github.com/example/repo.git").ID }}
```

#### Support for `ClusterAnalysisTemplate`s

It is now allowed to reference a `ClusterAnalysisTemplate` within the verification configuration of a `Stage`. This enables you as a Kargo operator to define [verification checks](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/how-to-guides/verification#configuring-verification) once and use them across multiple `Project`s:

```yaml
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Stage
metadata:
  name: dev
  namespace: guestbook
spec:
  # ...
  verification:
    analysisTemplates:
    - name: integration-test
      kind: ClusterAnalysisTemplate
```

Additionally, the `ClusterAnalysisTemplate`s can now be managed through the Kargo UI. Thanks to @BenHesketh21 for this contribution!

### ü™ú New and Updated Promotion Steps {#new-and-updated-promotion-steps}

- The new [`json-parse`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/json-parse) and [`yaml-parse`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/yaml-parse) steps allow for parsing JSON and YAML files to extract values from them.
- Thanks to @Tchoupinax, the [`git-open-pr`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/git-open-pr) and [`git-wait-for-pr`](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/reference-docs/promotion-steps/git-wait-for-pr) promotion steps do now support Gitea.

### üñ•Ô∏è UI Improvements {#ui-improvements}

- Scaling issues in the `Stage` pipeline view have been addressed.
- As noted in another section, `ClusterAnalysisTemplate`s can now be managed through the UI.

### üõ†Ô∏è Other Notable Changes {#other-notable-changes}

- You can now opt-in to allow credential lookups for HTTP URLs, refer to `controller.allowCredentialsOverHTTP` in the [chart documentation](https://github.com/akuity/kargo/tree/v1.3.0-rc.1/charts/kargo#controller) for more information.
- "Superstar" (i.e. `**`) glob patterns are now allowed in the [include and exclude paths of a `Warehouse`'s Git subscription](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/how-to-guides/working-with-warehouses#git-subscription-path-filtering), making it easier to include or exclude all files and/or directories in nested paths.
- The `Healthy` Condition of a `Stage` will now be `Unknown` instead of `False` when the last `Promotion` failed.
- Long `Stage` names will no longer result in `AnalysisRun` creation failures. (Thanks again @aidan-canva!)
