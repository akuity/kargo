# Quickstart

This guide presents a basic introduction to Kargo. Together, we will:

1. Create a local Kubernetes cluster with Kargo and its dependencies already
   installed.

1. Demonstrate how Kargo can progress changes through multiple stages by
   interacting with your GitOps repository and Argo CD `Application` resources.

1. Clean up.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [k3d](https://k3d.io/): These
  instructions were tested with:
    * kind: v0.17.0
    * k3d: v5.4.9
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/): These instructions were tested with v3.11.2.
* The `kargo` CLI: Download it from [the releases page](https://github.com/akuity/kargo/releases/latest).

### Starting a Local Cluster

With our prerequisites met, we can execute a helper script to launch a 
kind or k3d cluster and install Kargo along with its dependencies:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akuity/kargo/main/hack/quickstart/kind.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akuity/kargo/main/hack/quickstart/k3d.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="more-info" label="More Info">

:::info
If you are averse to piping a downloaded script directly into a shell, please
feel free to download the applicable script and inspect its contents prior to
execution.

Either script should only:

1. Launch a kind or k3d cluster
1. Install cert-manager
1. Install Argo CD
1. Install Kargo
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
If Kargo installation fails with a `403` it is likely that `docker` is
configured to authenticate to `ghcr.io` with an expired token.

To resolve this, remove or renew the credentials using one of:

* `docker logout ghcr.io`
* `docker login ghcr.io`
:::

At the end of this process:

* The Argo CD dashboard will be accessible at [localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).

  The username and password are both `admin`.

* The Kargo dashboard will be accessible at [localhost:8444](https://localhost:8444).

  The admin password is `admin`.

* You can safely ignore all cert errors for both of the above.

## Trying It Out

### Create a GitOps Repository

Let's begin by creating a repository on GitHub to house variations of our
application manifests for three different stages of a sample application: test,
UAT, and production.

Visit https://github.com/akuity/kargo-demo and fork the repository into your own
GitHub account.

You can explore the repository and see that the `main` branch contains common
configuration in a `base/` directory as well as stage-specific overlays in
paths of the form `stages/<stage name>/`. [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
is used as a configuration management tool that combines base configuration with
stage-specific configuration.

:::note
This layout is typical of a GitOps repository using Kustomize and is not at all
Kargo-specific.

Kargo also works just as well with Helm and with plain YAML.
:::

### Create Argo CD `Application` Resources

In this step, we will create three Argo CD `Application` resources that deploy
the sample application at three different stages of its lifecycle, with three
slightly different configurations, to three different namespaces in our local
cluster.

To get started, you will need a GitHub
[personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
with adequate permissions to read from and write to the repository you forked in
the previous section.

1. Save the location of your GitOps repository, your GitHub handle, and your
   personal access token in environment variables:

   ```shell
   export GITOPS_REPO_URL=<your repo URL, starting with https://>
   export GITHUB_USERNAME=<your github handle>
   export GITHUB_PAT=<your personal access token>
   ```

1. Create namespaces for each of our three stages, a `Secret` containing
   repository credentials, and Argo CD `Application` resources for each stage:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-test
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-uat
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-prod
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   type: Opaque
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-repo
     namespace: argocd
     labels:
       argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-projects: kargo-demo
   stringData:
     type: git
     project: default
     url: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
     username: ${GITHUB_USERNAME}
     password: ${GITHUB_PAT}
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-test
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage: kargo-demo:test
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: stage/test
       path: stages/test
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-test
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-uat
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage: kargo-demo:uat
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: stage/uat
       path: stages/uat
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-uat
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-prod
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage: kargo-demo:prod
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: stage/prod
       path: stages/prod
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-prod
   EOF
   ```

  If you visit [your Argo CD dashboard](https://localhost:8443), you will notice
  all three Argo CD `Application`s have not yet synced because they're not
  configured to do so automatically, and in fact, the branches referenced by their
  `targetRevision` fields do not even exist yet.

  :::info
  Our three stages all existing in a single cluster is for the sake of
  expediency. A single Argo CD control plane can manage multiple clusters, so
  these could also have been spread across multiple clusters.
  :::

### Hands on with the Kargo CLI

Up to this point, we haven't done anything with Kargo -- in fact everything
we've done thus far should be familiar to anyone who's already using Argo CD and
Kustomize. Now it's time to see what Kargo can do!

1. Begin by logging into Kargo:

  ```shell
  kargo login https://localhost:8444 \
    --admin \
    --password admin \
    --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  ```

1. Next, we'll create a Kargo project (a specially labeled namespace) and three
   Kargo `Stage` resources. This can be thought of as an orchestration layer for
   our GitOps repository and Argo CD `Application` resources.

  ```shell
  cat <<EOF | kargo apply -f -
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: kargo-demo
    labels:
      kargo.akuity.io/project: "true"
  ---
  apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Stage
  metadata:
    name: test
    namespace: kargo-demo
  spec:
    subscriptions:
      repos:
        images:
        - repoURL: nginx
          semverConstraint: ^1.24.0
    promotionMechanisms:
      gitRepoUpdates:
      - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
        writeBranch: stage/test
        kustomize:
          images:
          - image: nginx
            path: stages/test
      argoCDAppUpdates:
      - appName: kargo-demo-test
        appNamespace: argocd
  ---
  apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Stage
  metadata:
    name: uat
    namespace: kargo-demo
  spec:
    subscriptions:
      upstreamStages:
      - name: test
    promotionMechanisms:
      gitRepoUpdates:
      - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
        writeBranch: stage/uat
        kustomize:
          images:
          - image: nginx
            path: stages/uat
      argoCDAppUpdates:
      - appName: kargo-demo-uat
        appNamespace: argocd
  ---
  apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Stage
  metadata:
    name: prod
    namespace: kargo-demo
  spec:
    subscriptions:
      upstreamStages:
      - name: uat
    promotionMechanisms:
      gitRepoUpdates:
      - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
        writeBranch: stage/prod
        kustomize:
          images:
          - image: nginx
            path: stages/prod
      argoCDAppUpdates:
      - appName: kargo-demo-prod
        appNamespace: argocd
  EOF
  ```

  Use the CLI to view the three `Stage` resources in our new project:

  ```shell
  kargo get stages --project kargo-demo
  ```

  Sample output:

  ```shell
  NAME   CURRENT FREIGHT   HEALTH    AGE
  prod                     Healthy   20s
  test                     Healthy   20s
  uat                      Healthy   20s
  ```

1. Dissecting the manifest from the previous step, we see the `test` `Stage`
   subscribes directly to the `nginx` image repository. When a new version of
   the `nginx` container image matching the specified constraints is discovered,
   Kargo has discovered new `Freight`.

  :::info
  `Freight` is a set of references to one or more versioned artifacts, which and
  may include:

    * Container images (from image repositories)

    * Kubernetes manifests (from Git repositories)

    * Helm charts (from chart repositories)

  This introductory example has `Freight` that references only a specific
  version of the `nginx` container image.
  :::

  We can query the status of the `test` `Stage` to see the latest `Freight`
  available to it:

  ```shell
  kargo get stage test --project kargo-demo --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
  ```

  Truncated sample output:

  ```shell
  [
      {
          "availableFreight": [
              {
                  "firstSeen": "2023-09-20T18:09:05Z",
                  "id": "b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79",
                  "images": [
                      {
                          "repoURL": "nginx",
                          "tag": "1.25.2"
                      }
                  ],
                  "qualified": true
              }
          ],
          ...
      }
  ]
  ```

   Save the ID of the available `Freight` to an environment variable for
   convenience:

  ```shell
  export FREIGHT_ID=$(kargo get stage test --project kargo-demo --output jsonpath={.status.availableFreight\[0\].id})
  ```

  _Promote_ the `Freight` into the `test` `Stage`:

  ```shell
  kargo stage promote kargo-demo test --freight $FREIGHT_ID
  ```

  Sample output:

  ```shell
  Promotion Created: "test.01haswttm2p4qwcenpnn5s1m96.b73f9d1"
  ```

   Query for `Promotion` resources within our project to see one has been
   created and is currently pending:

  ```shell
  kargo get promotions --project kargo-demo
  ```

  Sample output:

  ```shell
  NAME                                      STAGE   FREIGHT                                    PHASE     AGE
  test.01haswttm2p4qwcenpnn5s1m96.b73f9d1   test    b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79   Pending   7s
  ```

  We can repeat the command above until our `Promotion` has succeeded.

  Once the `Promotion` has succeeded, we can, again view all `Stage` resources in
  our project, and at a glance, see that the `test` `Stage` is now either in a
  `Progressing` or `Healthy` state.

  ```shell
  kargo get stages --project kargo-demo
  ```

  Sample output:

  ```shell
  NAME   CURRENT FREIGHT                            HEALTH        AGE
  prod                                              Healthy       6m55s
  test   b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79   Progressing   6m55s
  uat                                               Healthy       6m55s
  ```

  We can repeat the command above until our `Promotion` is in a `Healthy` state.

  We can further validate the success of this entire process by visiting the
  test instance of our site at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

  If we once again view the `status` of our `test` `Stage` in more detail, we
  will see that it now reflects not only `Freight` available to the `Stage`, but
  also its current `Freight`, and the history of all `Freight` that have passed
  through this stage. (The collection is ordered most to least recent.)

  ```shell
  kargo get stage test --project kargo-demo --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
  ```

  Truncated sample output:

  ```shell
  [
      {
          "availableFreight": [
              ...
          ],
          "currentFreight": {
              "firstSeen": "2023-09-20T18:52:12Z",
              "id": "b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79",
              "images": [
                  {
                      "repoURL": "nginx",
                      "tag": "1.25.2"
                  }
              ],
              "qualified": true
          },
          ...
          "history": [
              {
                  "firstSeen": "2023-09-20T18:52:12Z",
                  "id": "b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79",
                  "images": [
                      {
                          "repoURL": "nginx",
                          "tag": "1.25.2"
                      }
                  ],
                  "qualified": true
              }
          ]
      }
  ]
  ```

  Importantly, by virtue of the `test` `Stage` having achieved a `Healthy` state
  with its current `Freight`, the sample output above shows the current
  `Freight` is now _qualified_, which designates it as eligible for promotion to
  the next `Stage` -- `uat`.

### Behind the Scenes

So what has Kargo done behind the scenes?

Visiting our fork of https://github.com/akuity/kargo-demo, we will see that
Kargo has recently created a `stage/test` branch for us. It has taken the latest
manifests from the `main` branch as a starting point, run `kargo edit set image`
within the `stages/test/` directory, and written the modified configuration to a
stage-specific branch -- the same branch referenced by the `test` Argo CD
`Applicaton`'s `targetRevision` field.

:::info
Although not strictly required for all cases, using stage-specific branches is a
suggested practice that enables Kargo to transition each `Stage` into any new or
previous state, at any time, with a new commit that replaces the entire contents
of the branch -- all without disrupting the `main` branch.
:::

### Promote to UAT and then Production

Unlike our `test` `Stage`, which subscribes directly to an image repository,
our `uat` and `prod` `Stage`s both subscribe to other, _upstream_ `Stage`s,
thereby forming a _pipeline_:

1. `uat` subscribes to `test`
1. `prod` subscribes to `uat`.

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to use the `kargo stage promote`
command to progress the `Freight` from `stage` to `uat` and again from `uat` to
`prod`.

:::info
The `uat` and `prod` instances of our site should be accessible at:

* `uat`: [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
* `prod`: [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
:::

:::info
It is possible to automate promotion of new, qualified `Freight` for designated
`Stage`s and also possible to used RBAC to limit who can trigger manual
promotions for each `Stage`, however, both these topics are beyond the scope of
this introduction.
:::

## Cleaning up

Congratulations! You've just gotten hands on with Kargo for the first time!

To clean up, we will simply destroy our kind or k3d cluster:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
kind delete cluster --name kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
k3d cluster delete kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
