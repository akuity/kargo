# Quickstart

This guide presents a basic introduction to Kargo. Together, we will:

1. Create a local Kubernetes cluster with Kargo and its dependencies already
   installed.

1. Install the Kargo CLI.

1. Demonstrate how Kargo can progress changes through multiple stages by
   interacting with your GitOps repository and Argo CD `Application` resources.

1. Clean up.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [k3d](https://k3d.io/): These
  instructions were tested with:
    * kind: v0.17.0
    * k3d: v5.4.9
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) v3.13.1 or greater

### Starting a Local Cluster

With our prerequisites met, we can execute a helper script to launch a 
kind or k3d cluster and install Kargo along with its dependencies:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akuity/kargo/main/hack/quickstart/kind.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akuity/kargo/main/hack/quickstart/k3d.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="more-info" label="More Info">

:::info
If you are averse to piping a downloaded script directly into a shell, please
feel free to download the applicable script and inspect its contents prior to
execution.

Either script should only:

1. Launch a kind or k3d cluster
1. Install cert-manager
1. Install Argo CD
1. Install Kargo
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
If Kargo installation fails with a `401`, verify that you are using Helm v3.13.1
or greater.

If Kargo installation fails with a `403`, it is likely that Docker is configured
to authenticate to `ghcr.io` with an expired token. The Kargo chart and images
are accessible anonymously, so this issue can be resolved simply by logging out:

```shell
docker logout ghcr.io
```
:::

At the end of this process:

* The Argo CD dashboard will be accessible at [localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).

  The username and password are both `admin`.

* The Kargo dashboard will be accessible at [localhost:8444](https://localhost:8444).

  The admin password is `admin`.

* You can safely ignore all cert errors for both of the above.

### Installing the Kargo CLI

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="general" label="Mac, Linux, or WSL" default>

To download the Kargo CLI:

```shell
arch=$(uname -m)
[ "$arch" = "x86_64" ] && arch=amd64
curl -L -o kargo https://github.com/akuity/kargo/releases/latest/download/kargo-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-${arch}
chmod +x kargo
```

Then move `kargo` to a location in your file system that is included in the
value of your `PATH` environment variable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows Powershell">

To download the Kargo CLI:

```shell
Invoke-WebRequest -URI https://github.com/akuity/kargo/releases/latest/download/kargo-windows-amd64.exe -OutFile kargo.exe
```

Then move `kargo.exe` to a location in your file system that is included in the value
of your `PATH` environment variable.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Trying It Out

### Create a GitOps Repository

Let's begin by creating a repository on GitHub to house variations of our
application manifests for three different stages of a sample application: test,
UAT, and production.

1. Visit https://github.com/akuity/kargo-demo and fork the repository into your
   own GitHub account.

1. You can explore the repository and see that the `main` branch contains common
   configuration in a `base/` directory as well as stage-specific overlays in
   paths of the form `stages/<stage name>/`.

    :::note
    This layout is typical of a GitOps repository using
    [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for configuration management and is not
    at all Kargo-specific.

    Kargo also works just as well with [Helm](https://helm.sh).
    :::

1. We'll be using it later, so save the location of your GitOps repository in an
   environment variable:

   ```shell
   export GITOPS_REPO_URL=<your repo URL, starting with https://>
   ```

### Create Argo CD `Application` Resources

In this step, we will create three Argo CD `Application` resources that deploy
the sample application at three different stages of its lifecycle, with three
slightly different configurations, to three different namespaces in our local
cluster:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo-test
  namespace: argocd
  annotations:
    kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage: kargo-demo:test
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
    targetRevision: stage/test
    path: stages/test
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: kargo-demo-test
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo-uat
  namespace: argocd
  annotations:
    kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage: kargo-demo:uat
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
    targetRevision: stage/uat
    path: stages/uat
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: kargo-demo-uat
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo-prod
  namespace: argocd
  annotations:
    kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage: kargo-demo:prod
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
    targetRevision: stage/prod
    path: stages/prod
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: kargo-demo-prod
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
EOF
```

If you visit [your Argo CD dashboard](https://localhost:8443), you will notice
all three Argo CD `Application`s have not yet synced because they're not
configured to do so automatically, and in fact, the branches referenced by their
`targetRevision` fields do not even exist yet.

:::info
Our three stages all existing in a single cluster is for the sake of expediency.
A single Argo CD control plane can manage multiple clusters, so these could just
as easily have been spread across multiple clusters.
:::

### Hands on with the Kargo CLI

Up to this point, we haven't done anything with Kargo -- in fact everything
we've done thus far should be familiar to anyone who's already using Argo CD and
Kustomize. Now it's time to see what Kargo can do!

To get started, you will need a GitHub
[personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
with adequate permissions to read from and write to the repository you forked in
the previous section.

1. Save your GitHub handle and your personal access token in environment
   variables:

   ```shell
   export GITHUB_USERNAME=<your github handle>
   export GITHUB_PAT=<your personal access token>
   ```

1. Then, log into Kargo:

    ```shell
    kargo login https://localhost:8444 \
      --admin \
      --password admin \
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify
    ```

1. Next, we'll create a Kargo project, which is really a specially labeled
   Kubernetes `Namespace`:

    ```shell
    kargo create project kargo-demo
    ```

1. To create some credentials (a Kubernetes `Secret`) for writing to our GitOps
   repository, we will fall back on `kubectl`:

    ```shell
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    type: Opaque
    metadata:
      name: kargo-demo-repo
      namespace: kargo-demo
      labels:
        kargo.akuity.io/secret-type: repository
    stringData:
      type: git
      project: default
      url: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
      username: ${GITHUB_USERNAME}
      password: ${GITHUB_PAT}
    EOF
    ```

    :::info
    Falling back on `kubectl` for credential management is necessary at this
    time because the Kargo API server lacks sufficient permissions to manage
    Kubernetes `Secret` resources.

    This will be addressed in future versions.
    :::

1. Next, returning to the `kargo` CLI, we create a `Warehouse` and three Kargo
   `Stage` resources. All of this his can be thought of as an orchestration
   layer for our GitOps repository and Argo CD `Application` resources.

    ```shell
    cat <<EOF | kargo apply -f -
    apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Warehouse
    metadata:
      name: kargo-demo
      namespace: kargo-demo
    spec:
      subscriptions:
      - image:
          repoURL: nginx
          semverConstraint: ^1.24.0
    ---
    apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Stage
    metadata:
      name: test
      namespace: kargo-demo
    spec:
      subscriptions:
        warehouse: kargo-demo
      promotionMechanisms:
        gitRepoUpdates:
        - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
          writeBranch: stage/test
          kustomize:
            images:
            - image: nginx
              path: stages/test
        argoCDAppUpdates:
        - appName: kargo-demo-test
          appNamespace: argocd
    ---
    apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Stage
    metadata:
      name: uat
      namespace: kargo-demo
    spec:
      subscriptions:
        upstreamStages:
        - name: test
      promotionMechanisms:
        gitRepoUpdates:
        - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
          writeBranch: stage/uat
          kustomize:
            images:
            - image: nginx
              path: stages/uat
        argoCDAppUpdates:
        - appName: kargo-demo-uat
          appNamespace: argocd
    ---
    apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Stage
    metadata:
      name: prod
      namespace: kargo-demo
    spec:
      subscriptions:
        upstreamStages:
        - name: uat
      promotionMechanisms:
        gitRepoUpdates:
        - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
          writeBranch: stage/prod
          kustomize:
            images:
            - image: nginx
              path: stages/prod
        argoCDAppUpdates:
        - appName: kargo-demo-prod
          appNamespace: argocd
    EOF
    ```

1. Use the CLI to view our `Warehouse` resource:

    ```shell
    kargo get warehouses --project kargo-demo
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    NAME         AGE
    kargo-demo   13s
    ```

1. Use the CLI to view our three `Stage` resources:

    ```shell
    kargo get stages --project kargo-demo
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    NAME   CURRENT FREIGHT   HEALTH    AGE
    prod                     Healthy   20s
    test                     Healthy   20s
    uat                      Healthy   20s
    ```

1. Our `Warehouse`, which subscribes to the `nginx` image repository, also
   should have already produced `Freight`:

    ```shell
    kargo get freight --project kargo-demo
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    NAME                                       AGE
    47b33c0c92b54439e5eb7fb80ecc83f8626fe390   5m49s
    ```
    :::info
    `Freight` is a set of references to one or more versioned artifacts, which
    may include:

      * Container images (from image repositories)

      * Kubernetes manifests (from Git repositories)

      * Helm charts (from chart repositories)

    This introductory example has `Freight` that references only a specific
    version of the `nginx` container image.
    :::

1. We'll use it later, so save the ID of the `Freight` to an environment
   variable:

    ```shell
    export FREIGHT_ID=$(kargo get freight --project kargo-demo --output jsonpath={.id})
    ```

1. Now, let's _promote_ the `Freight` into the `test` `Stage`:

    ```shell
    kargo stage promote kargo-demo test --freight $FREIGHT_ID
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    Promotion Created: "test.01haswttm2p4qwcenpnn5s1m96.b73f9d1"
    ```

    Query for `Promotion` resources within our project to see one has been
    created:

    ```shell
    kargo get promotions --project kargo-demo
    ```

    Our `Promotion` may briefly appear to be in a `Pending` phase, but more than
    likely, it will almost immediately be `Running`, or even `Succeeded`:

    ```shell
    NAME                                      STAGE   FREIGHT                                    PHASE     AGE
    test.01haswttm2p4qwcenpnn5s1m96.b73f9d1   test    b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79   Running   7s
    ```

    Once the `Promotion` has succeeded, we can again view all `Stage` resources
    in our project, and at a glance, see that the `test` `Stage` is now either
    in a `Progressing` or `Healthy` state.

    ```shell
    kargo get stages --project kargo-demo
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    NAME   CURRENT FREIGHT                            HEALTH        AGE
    prod                                              Healthy       6m55s
    test   b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79   Progressing   6m55s
    uat                                               Healthy       6m55s
    ```

    We can repeat the command above until our `Promotion` is in a `Healthy`
    state and we can further validate the success of this entire process by
    visiting the test instance of our site at
    [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

    If we once again view the `status` of our `test` `Stage` in more detail, we
    will see that it now reflects its current `Freight`, and the history of all
    `Freight` that have passed through this stage. (The collection is ordered
    most to least recent.)

    ```shell
    kargo get stage test --project kargo-demo --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
    ```

    Truncated sample output:

    ```shell
    {
        "currentFreight": {
            "id": "b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79",
            "images": [
                {
                    "repoURL": "nginx",
                    "tag": "1.25.3"
                }
            ],
        },
        ...
        "history": [
            {
                "id": "b73f9d1afaca87254b64e64e5439557e86dcba79",
                "images": [
                    {
                        "repoURL": "nginx",
                        "tag": "1.25.3"
                    }
                ],
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. If we look at our `Freight` in greater detail, we'll see that by virtue of
   the `test` `Stage` having achieved a `Healthy` state, the `Freight` is now
   _qualified_ in `test`, which designates it as eligible for promotion to the
   next `Stage` -- in our case, `uat`.

    ```shell
    kargo get freight $FREIGHT_ID --project kargo-demo --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    {
        "qualifications": {
            "test": {}
        }
    }
    ```

### Behind the Scenes

So what has Kargo done behind the scenes?

Visiting our fork of https://github.com/akuity/kargo-demo, we will see that
Kargo has recently created a `stage/test` branch for us. It has taken the latest
manifests from the `main` branch as a starting point, run `kustomize edit set image`
within the `stages/test/` directory, and written the modified configuration to a
stage-specific branch -- the same branch referenced by the `test` Argo CD
`Applicaton`'s `targetRevision` field.

:::info
Although not strictly required for all cases, using stage-specific branches is a
suggested practice that enables Kargo to transition each `Stage` into any new or
previous state, at any time, with a new commit that replaces the entire contents
of the branch -- all without disrupting the `main` branch.
:::

### Promote to UAT and then Production

Unlike our `test` `Stage`, which subscribes directly to an image repository,
our `uat` and `prod` `Stage`s both subscribe to other, _upstream_ `Stage`s,
thereby forming a _pipeline_:

1. `uat` subscribes to `test`
1. `prod` subscribes to `uat`.

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to use the `kargo stage promote`
command to progress the `Freight` from `stage` to `uat` and again from `uat` to
`prod`.

:::info
The `uat` and `prod` instances of our site should be accessible at:

* `uat`: [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
* `prod`: [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
:::

:::info
It is possible to automate promotion of new, qualified `Freight` for designated
`Stage`s and also possible to used RBAC to limit who can trigger manual
promotions for each `Stage`, however, both these topics are beyond the scope of
this introduction.
:::

## Cleaning up

Congratulations! You've just gotten hands on with Kargo for the first time!

To clean up, we will simply destroy our kind or k3d cluster:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
kind delete cluster --name kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
k3d cluster delete kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
