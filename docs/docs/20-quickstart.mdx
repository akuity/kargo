# Quickstart

This guide presents a basic introduction to K8sTA. Together, we will install
K8sTA with configuration appropriate for a local, development-grade cluster,
take it for a test drive, and then clean up.

## Prerequisites

:::caution
The configuration options used in this guide are appropriate only for evaluating
K8sTA on a local, development-grade cluster and are not appropriate for _any_
shared cluster -- _especially a production one_.
:::

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/): These instructions were tested with v3.10.0.
* A local [k3d](https://k3d.io/) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster 
  with [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io) pre-installed. These instructions
  were tested with:
    * k3d: v5.4.6
    * kind: v0.16.0
    * Argo CD: v2.4.12

### Starting a local cluster

We will start our cluster using options that make it convenient to access the
Argo CD dashboard, K8sTA server, and three different instances of our demo app
on different `localhost` ports:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
k3d cluster create k8sta-quickstart \
  --no-lb \
  --k3s-arg '--disable=traefik@server:0' \
  -p '8080-8084:30080-30084@servers:0:direct' \
  --wait
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
kind create cluster \
  --wait 120s \
  --config - <<EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
name: k8sta-quickstart
nodes:
- extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 30080
    hostPort: 8080
  - containerPort: 30081
    hostPort: 8081
  - containerPort: 30082
    hostPort: 8082
  - containerPort: 30083
    hostPort: 8083
  - containerPort: 30084
    hostPort: 8084
EOF
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing Argo CD

```shell
helm install argo-cd argo-cd \
  --repo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm \
  --version 5.5.6 \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace argo-cd \
  --set 'configs.secret.argocdServerAdminPassword=$2a$10$5vm8wXaSdbuff0m9l21JdevzXBzJFPCi8sy6OOnpZMAG.fOXL7jvO' \
  --set dex.enabled=false \
  --set notifications.enabled=false \
  --set server.extensions.enabled=true \
  --set server.service.type=NodePort \
  --set server.service.nodePortHttp=30080 \
  --wait
```

The Argo CD dashboard will be accessible at
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The username and password are both `admin`.

## Installing K8sTA

:::info
The Helm charts for K8sTA, much like K8sTA's container images, are hosted in the
GitHub Container Registry and are currently accessible only by Akuity employees.
This means you will need to log into the `ghcr.io` registry to proceed, exactly
as if you were going to pull a private image from there.

When K8sTA is eventually made public, this step will no longer be necessary.
:::

Use the command `docker login ghcr.io` and follow the prompts. Use your GitHub
handle for the username and, for the password, use a
[personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with adequate
permissions to pull packages, then:

```shell
helm install k8sta \
  oci://ghcr.io/akuityio/k8sta-chart/k8sta \
  --version v0.1.0-alpha.1 \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace k8sta \
  --set server.service.type=NodePort \
  --set server.service.nodePort=30081 \
  --set server.tls.enabled=false \
  --set server.dockerhub.tokens.dev-token=insecure-dev-token \
  --wait
```

## Trying it out

### 1. Create a GitOps repo

In the step, we will create a GitOps repo on GitHub to house variations of our
application manifests for three different environments: dev, int, and prod. This
repo will observe necessary K8sTA conventions.

Visit https://github.com/akuityio/k8sta-demo-deploy and fork the repository into
your own GitHub account.

You can explore the repository and observe that the `main` branch contains
common configuration in a `base/` directory and that `kustomize` is used to as a
configuration management tool, applying environment-specific overlays to the
base configuration. The overlays for each environment are defined in their
respective `env/<environment name>/` directories. This repository layout is a
required K8sTA convention.

:::info
`ytt` and `helm` are supported alternatives to `kustomize`, however, this guide
only utilizes `kustomize`.
:::

While the `main` branch contains everything necessary to render the
configuration for any of our three environments, we will see as we move into the
next section that our Argo CD `Application` resources will not reference the
`main` branch or the `env/<environment name>/` directories directly. Instead, as
K8sTA progresses our initial deployments and any subsequent changes through our
environments, it will automatically render base configuration and
environment-specific overlays into plain Kubernetes manifests and store them in
environment-specific _branches_. These are what our Argo CD `Application`
resources will reference.

:::info
This is commonly referred to as the "rendered YAML branches" pattern.
:::

### 2. Create Argo CD Applications

In this step, we will create three Argo CD `Application` resources that deploy
the same application, with three slightly different configurations, to three
different namespaces in our local cluster. These three instances of the same
application will represent the three environments.

To get started, you will require a GitHub [personal access
token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with adequate permissions to read
from and write to repositories.

1. Save the location of your GitOps repo, your GitHub handle, and your personal
   access token in environment variables:

   ```shell
   export GITOPS_REPO_URL=<your repo URL, starting with https://>
   export GITHUB_USERNAME=<your github handle>
   export GITHUB_PAT=<your personal access token>
   ```

1. Create namespaces for our three environments, a `Secret` containing
   repository credentials, and Argo CD `Application` resources for each
   environment:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: k8sta-demo-dev
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: k8sta-demo-int
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: k8sta-demo-prod
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   type: Opaque
   metadata:
     name: repo-creds
     namespace: argo-cd
     labels:
       argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository
   stringData:
     type: git
     project: default
     url: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
     username: ${GITHUB_USERNAME}
     password: ${GITHUB_PAT}
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: k8sta-demo-dev
     namespace: argo-cd
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: env/dev
       path: .
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: k8sta-demo-dev
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: k8sta-demo-int
     namespace: argo-cd
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: env/int
       path: .
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: k8sta-demo-int
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: k8sta-demo-prod
     namespace: argo-cd
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: env/prod
       path: .
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: k8sta-demo-prod
   EOF
   ```

If you visit [your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) at this point, you
will notice all three Argo CD `Application`s have failed to sync. _This is
because the environment-specific branched out your GitOps repo do not exist
yet!_ That's okay, though. K8sTA will create those branches for us as we
continue this guide.

:::info
Our three environments all existing in a single cluster is for the sake of
convenience. Because a single Argo CD control plane can manage multiple
clusters, we could just as easily spread our environments across multiple
clusters.
:::

### 3. Create a K8sTA Track

In this step, we will create a K8sTA `Track` resource that describes the
relationships between our three environments (our three Argo CD `Application`s).

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: k8sta.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Track
metadata:
  name: k8sta-demo
  namespace: argo-cd
spec:
  imageRepositorySubscriptions:
  gitRepositorySubscription:
    repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
  configManagement:
    kustomize: {}
  stations:
  - name: dev
    applications:
    - name: k8sta-demo-dev
  - name: int
    applications:
    - name: k8sta-demo-int
  - name: prod
    applications:
    - name: k8sta-demo-prod
EOF
```

### 4. Trigger an initial deployment

In this step, we will trigger an initial deployment of our application and watch
it progress through all three environments, one by one, and observe the
bookkeeping K8sTA performs in the process.

There are many different ways K8sTA can detect that your GitOps repo contains
changes that should be progressed through the environments enumerated by a
`Track`. For convenience we will use the method requiring the least setup.

In your GitOps repo, find the line in `base/deployment.yaml` with the text
`image: argoproj/rollouts-demo:placeholder` and update the image to be
`argoproj/rollouts-demo:blue`. Commit this change to the `main` branch. You may
accomplish this however you like. Making the modification directly via GitHub's
web UI is a convenient option.

Once the change is present in your GitOps repo, K8sTA will detect the change
and upon noticing the change is within the `base/` directory, will infer that
this change is likely to impact all environments. It will therefor create a
`Ticket` resource that represents the change as it is progresses, one by one,
through the environments enumerated by our `Track`.

If you visit [your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080), you can watch
K8sTA progress this change through all three environments. One by one, the Argo
CD `Application`s representing those environments will become ✅ synced and 💚
healthy.

The three application instances should also be visible in your web browser by
visiting:

* dev: [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
* int: [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
* prod: [localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)

If you browse to your GitOps repo on GitHub and explore, you will be able to
note of all the bookkeeping that K8sTA has done on our behalf:

* K8sTA has made a number of commits to the `main` branch to store some
  intermediate state in a `.k8sta/` directory. There is no particular need for
  you to understand what is stored in that directory, and you should never have
  any need to make changes to any resources in that directory.

* K8sTA has created environment-specific branches for our dev, int, and prod
  environments. If you explore those branches, you will find that they are
  _orphaned branches_, having no common history with the `main` branch, and each
  contains a single plain YAML file. This is what Argo CD actually deploys to
  each environment.

### 5. Roll out a change

In this step, we will roll out a small change that will, again, progress through
all three environments, one by one. Again, we will observe the bookkeeping K8sTA
performs in the process.

Repeat the steps of the previous section, this time finding the line in
`base/deployment.yaml` with the text `image: argoproj/rollouts-demo:blue` and
update the image to be `argoproj/rollouts-demo:green`.

Once again, you can:

1. Observe the progressive deployment of the change in [your Argo CD
   dashboard](http://localhost:8080).

1. Visit the applications in your web browser to observe that the software has
   indeed been updated.

1. Explore the bookkeeping K8sTA has performed in your GitOps repo.
