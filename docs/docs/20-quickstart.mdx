# Quickstart

This guide presents a basic introduction to Kargo. Together, we will:

1. Create a local Kubernetes cluster.

1. Install Kargo's dependencies, including Argo CD.

1. Install Kargo itself with default options.

1. Demonstrate how Kargo can progress changes through multiple environments by
   interacting with your GitOps repository and Argo CD `Application` resources.

1. Clean up.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [k3d](https://k3d.io/): These
  instructions were tested with:
    * kind: v0.17.0
    * k3d: v5.4.9
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/): These instructions were tested with v3.11.2.

### Starting a local cluster

We will start our cluster using options that make it convenient to access the
Argo CD dashboard and three different instances of our demo application on
different `localhost` ports:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
kind create cluster \
  --wait 120s \
  --config - <<EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
name: kargo-quickstart
nodes:
- extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 30080
    hostPort: 8080
  - containerPort: 30081
    hostPort: 8081
  - containerPort: 30082
    hostPort: 8082
  - containerPort: 30083
    hostPort: 8083
EOF
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
k3d cluster create kargo-quickstart \
  --no-lb \
  --k3s-arg '--disable=traefik@server:0' \
  -p '8080-8083:30080-30083@servers:0:direct' \
  --wait
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing cert-manager

:::info
In its default configuration, Kargo uses cert-manager to provision a self-signed
certificate for use by Kargo's webhook server. In a more advanced installation,
you may optionally disregard this dependency by providing a certificate yourself
through any means you prefer.
:::

```shell
helm install cert-manager cert-manager \
  --repo https://charts.jetstack.io \
  --version 1.11.0 \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set installCRDs=true \
  --wait
```

### Installing Argo CD

:::info
Kargo works best when integrated with Argo CD, but we're working on reducing
this dependency from a required one to a suggested one.
:::

```shell
helm install argocd argo-cd \
  --repo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm \
  --version 5.21.0 \
  --namespace argocd \
  --create-namespace \
  --set 'configs.secret.argocdServerAdminPassword=$2a$10$5vm8wXaSdbuff0m9l21JdevzXBzJFPCi8sy6OOnpZMAG.fOXL7jvO' \
  --set dex.enabled=false \
  --set notifications.enabled=false \
  --set server.extensions.enabled=true \
  --set server.service.type=NodePort \
  --set server.service.nodePortHttp=30080 \
  --wait
```

The Argo CD dashboard will be accessible at
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The username and password are both `admin`.

## Installing Kargo

```shell
helm install kargo \
  oci://ghcr.io/akuity/kargo-charts/kargo \
  --version 0.1.0-rc.6 \
  --namespace kargo \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

## Trying it out

### Create a GitOps repository

In this step, we will create a GitOps repo on GitHub to house variations of our
application manifests for three different environments: `test`, `stage`, and
`prod`.

Visit https://github.com/akuity/kargo-demo and fork the repository into your own
GitHub account.

You can explore the repository and see that the `main` branch contains common
configuration in a `base/` directory as well as environment-specific overlays in
paths of the form `env/<environment name>/`. [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
is used as a configuration management tool that combines base configuration with
environment-specific configuration.

:::note
This layout is typical of a GitOps repository using Kustomize and is not at all
Kargo-specific.
:::

### Create Argo CD Applications

In this step, we will create three Argo CD `Application` resources that deploy
the same application, with three slightly different configurations, to three
different namespaces in our local cluster. These three instances of the same
application will represent `test`, `stage`, and `prod` environments.

To get started, you will require a GitHub [personal access
token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with adequate permissions to read
from and write to the repository you forked in the previous section.

1. Save the location of your GitOps repository, your GitHub handle, and your
   personal access token in environment variables:

   ```shell
   export GITOPS_REPO_URL=<your repo URL, starting with https://>
   export GITHUB_USERNAME=<your github handle>
   export GITHUB_PAT=<your personal access token>
   ```

1. Create namespaces for our three environments, a `Secret` containing
   repository credentials, and Argo CD `Application` resources for each
   environment:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-test
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-stage
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-prod
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   type: Opaque
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-repo
     namespace: argocd
     labels:
       argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository
   stringData:
     type: git
     project: default
     url: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
     username: ${GITHUB_USERNAME}
     password: ${GITHUB_PAT}
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-test
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-env: kargo-demo:test
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: placeholder
       path: env/test
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-test
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-stage
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-env: kargo-demo:stage
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: placeholder
       path: env/stage
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-stage
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-prod
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-env: kargo-demo:prod
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: placeholder
       path: env/prod
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-prod
   EOF
   ```

If you visit [your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080), you will notice
all three Argo CD `Application`s have not yet synced because they're not
configured to do so automatically. If you manually sync any one of them, they
will fail to reach a healthy state because all three `Application`s'
`targetRevision` fields reference a non-existent `placeholder` branch.

:::info
Our three environments all existing in a single cluster is for the sake of
convenience. Because a single Argo CD control plane can manage multiple
clusters, we could just as easily have spread our environments across multiple
clusters.
:::

### Create Kargo PromotionPolicies and Environments

Up to this point, we haven't done anything with Kargo -- in fact everything
we've done thus far should be familiar to anyone who's already using Argo CD and
Kustomize.

In this step, we'll create three Kargo `Environment` resources. These can be
thought of as a layer "above" your Argo CD `Application`s. Their role is to
describe subscriptions to different materials (like manifests or container
images), the process for deploying those materials, and the process for
asserting whether they are properly deployed and healthy. For a simple example,
such as ours, this means:

* Watching our GitOps repository for updated manifests.
* Watching the `nginx` image repository for new versions.
* Automating relevant changes to the GitOps repository and affected Argo CD
  `Application` resources.
* Monitoring the health and sync state of Argo CD `Application` resources.

We will also create three `PromotionPolicy` resources that will express
permission for new materials to be deployed _automatically_ to the
`kargo-demo-test` and `kargo-demo-stage` environments, and permission for the
`kubernetes-admin` user to deploy new materials _manually_ to any of the
environments. In fact, we will create these `PromotionPolicy` resource first:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: PromotionPolicy
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: kargo-demo
environment: test
authorizedPromoters:
- subjectType: User
  name: kubernetes-admin
enableAutoPromotion: true
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: PromotionPolicy
metadata:
  name: stage
  namespace: kargo-demo
environment: stage
authorizedPromoters:
- subjectType: User
  name: kubernetes-admin
enableAutoPromotion: true
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: PromotionPolicy
metadata:
  name: prod
  namespace: kargo-demo
environment: prod
authorizedPromoters:
- subjectType: User
  name: kubernetes-admin
EOF
```

#### The `test` `Environment`

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  subscriptions:
    repos:
      git:
      - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
      images:
      - repoURL: nginx
        semverConstraint: 1.23.2
  promotionMechanisms:
    gitRepoUpdates:
    - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
      kustomize:
        images:
        - image: nginx
          path: base
    argoCDAppUpdates:
    - appName: kargo-demo-test
      appNamespace: argocd
      sourceUpdates:
      - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
        updateTargetRevision: true
  healthChecks:
    argoCDAppChecks:
    - appName: kargo-demo-test
      appNamespace: argocd
EOF
```

Dissecting the manifest above, we see the `test` `Environment` subscribes
directly to our GitOps repository and the `nginx` image repository. When a new
commit is discovered in our GitOps repository or a new, semantically tagged
version of the `nginx` container image is discovered, the two are combined into
a new _state_. Because the corresponding `PromotionPolicy` resource permits
auto-promotion, the discovery of this new state will immediately result in the
creation of a new `Promotion` resource that will effect the transition of the
`Environment` to that state.

The actual promotion process involves running `kustomize edit set image` on the
`base` directory of our GitOps repository and committing those changes, then
updating the `targetRevision` property of the `kargo-demo-test` Argo CD
`Application`.

:::note
Due to an [as-yet-unresolved bug](https://github.com/akuity/kargo/issues/313),
the `semverConstraint` field in the `test` `Environment` manifest above is
pinned to a _specific_ semantically tagged image rather than specifying a range
like `^1.0.0`.
:::

:::note
It may seem strange to some that we are updating Kustomize _base_ configuration
instead of an environment-specific overlay.

In this particular scenario, our method of progressing changes from one
environment to another involves, updating each `Application`s `targetRevision`
field.

Progressing changes from directory-to-directory (Kustomize overlays, for
instance) is another viable strategy, but is not the strategy demonstrated in
this example.
:::

After creating the `test` `Environment` resource, we should almost immediately
see:

1. The `test` `Environment` has been assigned a current state and is healthy:

   ```text
   kubectl get environment test --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

  ```text
   NAME   CURRENT STATE                              HEALTH    AGE
   test   6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Healthy   30s
   ```

1. The `test` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the one available
   state, the current state, and the history of all states this `Environment`
   has been in:

   ```text
   kubectl get environment test \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. A `Promotion` resource was created which was responsible for the `test`
   `Environment` transitioning into its one available state.

   ```texts
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME                                               ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   test-to-6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   test          6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   55s
   ```

1. Your GitOps repository has a new commit.

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-test`
   `Application` is synced and healthy. You can also see that its
   `targetRevision` field has been updated to reference the new commit in your
   GitOps repository.

#### The `stage` `Environment`

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: stage
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  subscriptions:
    upstreamEnvs:
    - name: test
  promotionMechanisms:
    argoCDAppUpdates:
    - appName: kargo-demo-stage
      appNamespace: argocd
      sourceUpdates:
      - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
        updateTargetRevision: true
  healthChecks:
    argoCDAppChecks:
    - appName: kargo-demo-stage
      appNamespace: argocd
EOF
```

Dissecting the manifest above, we see the `stage` `Environment` is quite
different from the `test` `Environment` in that it does not find new states by
subscribing directly to repositories, but discovers them by monitoring the
"upstream" `test` `Environment`. Any healthy state from the `test`
`Environment`'s `history` field becomes available state for the `stage`
`Environment`. Because the corresponding `PromotionPolicy` resource permits
auto-promotion, the discovery of the `test` `Environment`'s current, healthy
state immediately result in the creation of a new `Promotion` resource that will
effect the transition of the `Environment` to that state.

The `promotionMechanisms` are also substantially different from those in the
`test` `Environment`, as they make no commit to the GitOps repository, and
_only_ update the `targetRevision` property of the `kargo-demo-stage` Argo CD
`Application`.

After creating the `stage` `Environment` resource, we should almost immediately
see:

1. The `stage` `Environment` has been assigned a current state and is healthy:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment stage --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME    CURRENT STATE                              HEALTH    AGE
   stage   6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Healthy   13s
   ```

1. The `stage` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the one
   available state, the current state, and the history of all states this
   `Environment` has been in:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment stage \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. A `Promotion` resource was created which was responsible for the `stage`
   `Environment` transitioning into its one available state -- the same state
   that the `test` `Environment` is already in.

   ```shell
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```shell
   NAME                                                ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   stage-to-6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   stage         6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   43s
   test-to-6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38    test          6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   2m40s
   ```

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-stage`
   `Application` is synced and healthy. You can also see that its
   `targetRevision` field has been updated to reference the same commit as the
   `kargo-demo-test` `Application`.

#### The `prod` `Environment`:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: prod
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  subscriptions:
    upstreamEnvs:
    - name: stage
  promotionMechanisms:
    argoCDAppUpdates:
    - appName: kargo-demo-prod
      appNamespace: argocd
      sourceUpdates:
      - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
        updateTargetRevision: true
  healthChecks:
    argoCDAppChecks:
    - appName: kargo-demo-prod
      appNamespace: argocd
EOF
```

Dissecting the manifest above, we see the `prod` `Environment` is remarkably
similar to the `stage` `Environment`. It discovers new states by monitoring the
"upstream" `stage` `Environment`. Any healthy state from the `stage`
`Environment`'s `history` field becomes available state for the `prod`
`Environment`.

Because the corresponding `PromotionPolicy` resource does _not_ permits
auto-promotion, no `Promotion` resource should be automatically created.

After creating the `prod` `Environment` resource, we should almost immediately
see:

1. The `prod` `Environment` has not yet been assigned a current state:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment prod --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME   CURRENT STATE   HEALTH   AGE
   prod                            12s
   ```

1. The `prod` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the one
   available state, but shows no current state or history:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment stage \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. No `Promotion` resource was automatically created to transition the `prod`
   `Environment` into its one available state.

   ```shell
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```shell
   NAME                                                ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   stage-to-6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   stage         6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   2m7s
   test-to-6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38    test          6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   4m4s
   ```

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-prod`
   `Application` is _still_ not synced and healthy.

### Trigger a promotion to prod

In this step, we will trigger a promotion to transition the `prod` `Environment`
into a new state by manually creating a `Promotion` resource.

First, copy the ID of the `stage` `Environment`'s current state and assign it to
`STATE_ID` environment variable:

```shell
export STATE_ID=$(kubectl get environment stage -n kargo-demo -o jsonpath={.status.currentState.id})
```

Then apply the following:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promotion
metadata:
  name: my-first-prod-promotion
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  environment: prod
  state: ${STATE_ID}
EOF
```

After a few moments, we should be able to see:

1. The `Promotion` has succeeded:

   ```shell
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME                                                ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   my-first-prod-promotion                             prod          6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   12s
   stage-to-6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   stage         6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   6m14ss
   test-to-6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38    test          6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Completed   8m11s
   ```

1. The `prod` `Environment` has now been assigned a current state:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment prod --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME   CURRENT STATE                              HEALTH    AGE
   prod   6cdf3dc80f2eb4de2353b9e823f759b83af4df38   Healthy   5m20s
   ```

1. The `prod` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the available
   state, the current state, and the history of all states this `Environment`
   has been in:

   ```text
   kubectl get environment prod \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-prod`
   `Application` is now not synced and healthy.

## Cleaning up

To clean up, we will simply destroy our kind or k3d cluster:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
kind delete cluster --name kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
k3d cluster delete kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
