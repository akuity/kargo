# Quickstart

This guide presents a basic introduction to Kargo. Together, we will:

1. Create a local Kubernetes cluster.

1. Install Kargo's dependencies, including Argo CD.

1. Install Kargo itself with default options.

1. Demonstrate how Kargo can progress changes through multiple environments by
   interacting with your GitOps repository and Argo CD `Application` resources.

1. Clean up.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [k3d](https://k3d.io/): These
  instructions were tested with:
    * kind: v0.17.0
    * k3d: v5.4.9
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/): These instructions were tested with v3.11.2.

### Starting a local cluster

We will start our cluster using options that make it convenient to access the
Argo CD dashboard and three different instances of our demo application on
different `localhost` ports:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
kind create cluster \
  --wait 120s \
  --config - <<EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
name: kargo-quickstart
nodes:
- extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 30080 # Argo CD dashboard
    hostPort: 8080
  - containerPort: 30081 # test application
    hostPort: 8081
  - containerPort: 30082 # stage application
    hostPort: 8082
  - containerPort: 30083 # prod application
    hostPort: 8083
EOF
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
k3d cluster create kargo-quickstart \
  --no-lb \
  --k3s-arg '--disable=traefik@server:0' \
  -p '8080-8083:30080-30083@servers:0:direct' \
  --wait
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing cert-manager

:::info
In its default configuration, Kargo uses cert-manager to provision a self-signed
certificate for use by Kargo's webhook server. In a more advanced installation,
you may optionally disregard this dependency by providing a certificate yourself
through any means you prefer.
:::

```shell
helm install cert-manager cert-manager \
  --repo https://charts.jetstack.io \
  --version 1.11.0 \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set installCRDs=true \
  --wait
```

### Installing Argo CD

:::info
Kargo works best when integrated with Argo CD, but we're working on reducing
this dependency from a required one to a suggested one.
:::

```shell
helm install argocd argo-cd \
  --repo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm \
  --version 5.21.0 \
  --namespace argocd \
  --create-namespace \
  --set 'configs.secret.argocdServerAdminPassword=$2a$10$5vm8wXaSdbuff0m9l21JdevzXBzJFPCi8sy6OOnpZMAG.fOXL7jvO' \
  --set dex.enabled=false \
  --set notifications.enabled=false \
  --set server.service.type=NodePort \
  --set server.service.nodePortHttp=30080 \
  --wait
```

The Argo CD dashboard will be accessible at
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You can safely ignore cert errors.

The username and password are both `admin`.

## Installing Kargo

```shell
helm install kargo \
  oci://ghcr.io/akuity/kargo-charts/kargo \
  --version 0.1.0-rc.10 \
  --namespace kargo \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

## Trying it out

### Create a GitOps repository

In this step, we will create a GitOps repo on GitHub to house variations of our
application manifests for three different environments: `test`, `stage`, and
`prod`.

Visit https://github.com/akuity/kargo-demo and fork the repository into your own
GitHub account.

You can explore the repository and see that the `main` branch contains common
configuration in a `base/` directory as well as environment-specific overlays in
paths of the form `env/<environment name>/`. [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
is used as a configuration management tool that combines base configuration with
environment-specific configuration.

:::note
This layout is typical of a GitOps repository using Kustomize and is not at all
Kargo-specific.
:::

### Create Argo CD Applications

In this step, we will create three Argo CD `Application` resources that deploy
the same application, with three slightly different configurations, to three
different namespaces in our local cluster. These three instances of the same
application will represent `test`, `stage`, and `prod` environments.

To get started, you will require a GitHub [personal access
token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with adequate permissions to read
from and write to the repository you forked in the previous section.

1. Save the location of your GitOps repository, your GitHub handle, and your
   personal access token in environment variables:

   ```shell
   export GITOPS_REPO_URL=<your repo URL, starting with https://>
   export GITHUB_USERNAME=<your github handle>
   export GITHUB_PAT=<your personal access token>
   ```

1. Create Projects for our three environments (a Kargo Project is a Kubernetes Namespace indicated by the `kargo.akuity.io/project` label), a `Secret` containing
   repository credentials, and Argo CD `Application` resources for each
   environment:

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-test
     labels:
      kargo.akuity.io/project: "true"
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-stage
     labels:
      kargo.akuity.io/project: "true"
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-prod
     labels:
      kargo.akuity.io/project: "true"
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   type: Opaque
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-repo
     namespace: argocd
     labels:
       argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-projects: kargo-demo
   stringData:
     type: git
     project: default
     url: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
     username: ${GITHUB_USERNAME}
     password: ${GITHUB_PAT}
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-test
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-env: kargo-demo:test
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: main
       path: env/test
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-test
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-stage
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-env: kargo-demo:stage
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: main
       path: env/stage
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-stage
   ---
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kargo-demo-prod
     namespace: argocd
     annotations:
       kargo.akuity.io/authorized-env: kargo-demo:prod
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
       targetRevision: main
       path: env/prod
     destination:
       server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       namespace: kargo-demo-prod
   EOF
   ```

If you visit [your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080), you will notice
all three Argo CD `Application`s have not yet synced because they're not
configured to do so automatically.

:::info
Our three environments all existing in a single cluster is for the sake of
convenience. Because a single Argo CD control plane can manage multiple
clusters, we could just as easily have spread our environments across multiple
clusters.
:::

### Create Kargo PromotionPolicies and Environments

Up to this point, we haven't done anything with Kargo -- in fact everything
we've done thus far should be familiar to anyone who's already using Argo CD and
Kustomize.

In this step, we'll create three Kargo `Environment` resources. These can be
thought of as a layer "above" your Argo CD `Application`s. Their role is to
describe subscriptions to different materials (like manifests or container
images), the process for deploying those materials, and the process for
asserting whether they are properly deployed and healthy. For a simple example,
such as ours, this means:

* Watching the `nginx` image repository for new versions.
* Automating relevant changes to the GitOps repository and affected Argo CD
  `Application` resources.
* Monitoring the health and sync state of Argo CD `Application` resources.

We will also create three `PromotionPolicy` resources that will express
permission for new materials to be deployed _automatically_ to the
`kargo-demo-test` and `kargo-demo-stage` environments, and permission for
members of the `system:masters` group to deploy new materials _manually_ to any
of the environments. (This should cover both kind and k3d users.) In fact, we
will create these `PromotionPolicy` resources first:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo
  labels:
    kargo.akuity.io/project: "true"
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: PromotionPolicy
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: kargo-demo
environment: test
authorizedPromoters:
- subjectType: Group
  name: system:masters
enableAutoPromotion: true
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: PromotionPolicy
metadata:
  name: stage
  namespace: kargo-demo
environment: stage
authorizedPromoters:
- subjectType: Group
  name: system:masters
enableAutoPromotion: true
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: PromotionPolicy
metadata:
  name: prod
  namespace: kargo-demo
environment: prod
authorizedPromoters:
- subjectType: Group
  name: system:masters
EOF
```

#### The `test` `Environment`

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  subscriptions:
    repos:
      images:
      - repoURL: nginx
        semverConstraint: ^1.24.0
  promotionMechanisms:
    gitRepoUpdates:
    - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
      writeBranch: main
      kustomize:
        images:
        - image: nginx
          path: env/test
    argoCDAppUpdates:
    - appName: kargo-demo-test
      appNamespace: argocd
EOF
```

Dissecting the manifest above, we see the `test` `Environment` subscribes
directly to the `nginx` image repository. When a new, semantically tagged
version of the `nginx` container image is discovered, Kargo has discovered a new
_state_. Because the corresponding `PromotionPolicy` resource permits
auto-promotion, the discovery of this new state will immediately result in the
creation of a new `Promotion` resource that will effect the transition of the
`Environment` to that state.

The actual promotion process involves running `kustomize edit set image` on the
`env/test` directory of our GitOps repository and committing those changes, then
forcing the `kargo-demo-test` Argo CD `Application` to refresh and sync.

After creating the `test` `Environment` resource, we should almost immediately
see:

1. The `test` `Environment` has been assigned a current state and is healthy:

   ```text
   kubectl get environment test --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

  ```text
   NAME   CURRENT STATE                              HEALTH    AGE
   test   d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Healthy   30s
   ```

1. The `test` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the one available
   state, the current state, and the history of all states this `Environment`
   has been in:

   ```text
   kubectl get environment test \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. A `Promotion` resource was created which was responsible for the `test`
   `Environment` transitioning into its one available state.

   ```texts
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME                                               ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   test-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   test          d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   55s
   ```

1. Your GitOps repository has a new commit.

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-test`
   `Application` is synced and healthy.

   Nginx running in the test environment is visible at
   [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

#### The `stage` `Environment`

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: stage
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  subscriptions:
    upstreamEnvs:
    - name: test
  promotionMechanisms:
    gitRepoUpdates:
    - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
      writeBranch: main
      kustomize:
        images:
        - image: nginx
          path: env/stage
    argoCDAppUpdates:
    - appName: kargo-demo-stage
      appNamespace: argocd
EOF
```

Dissecting the manifest above, we see the `stage` `Environment` is somewhat
different from the `test` `Environment` in that it does not find new states by
subscribing directly to an image repository, but discovers them by monitoring
the "upstream" `test` `Environment`. Any healthy state from the `test`
`Environment`'s `history` field becomes available state for the `stage`
`Environment`. Because the corresponding `PromotionPolicy` resource permits
auto-promotion, the discovery of the `test` `Environment`'s current, healthy
state immediately results in the creation of a new `Promotion` resource that will
effect the transition of the `Environment` to that state.

The `promotionMechanisms` for the `stage` `Environment` are not substantially
different from those for the `test` `Environment`. They involve running
`kustomize edit set image` on the `env/stage` directory of our GitOps repository
and committing those changes, then forcing the `kargo-demo-stage` Argo CD
`Application` to refresh and sync.

After creating the `stage` `Environment` resource, we should almost immediately
see:

1. The `stage` `Environment` has been assigned a current state and is healthy:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment stage --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME    CURRENT STATE                              HEALTH    AGE
   stage   d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Healthy   13s
   ```

1. The `stage` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the one
   available state, the current state, and the history of all states this
   `Environment` has been in:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment stage \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. A `Promotion` resource was created which was responsible for the `stage`
   `Environment` transitioning into its one available state -- the same state
   that the `test` `Environment` is already in.

   ```shell
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```
   NAME                                                ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   stage-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   stage         d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   43s
   test-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686    test          d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   2m40s
   ```

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-stage`
   `Application` is synced and healthy.

   Nginx running in the stage environment is visible at
   [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).

#### The `prod` `Environment`:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: prod
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  subscriptions:
    upstreamEnvs:
    - name: stage
  promotionMechanisms:
    gitRepoUpdates:
    - repoURL: ${GITOPS_REPO_URL}
      writeBranch: main
      kustomize:
        images:
        - image: nginx
          path: env/prod
    argoCDAppUpdates:
    - appName: kargo-demo-prod
      appNamespace: argocd
EOF
```

Dissecting the manifest above, we see the `prod` `Environment` is remarkably
similar to the `stage` `Environment`. It discovers new states by monitoring the
"upstream" `stage` `Environment`. Any healthy state from the `stage`
`Environment`'s `history` field becomes available state for the `prod`
`Environment`.

The `promotionMechanisms` for the `prod` `Environment` also are not
substantially different from those for either the `test` or `stage`
`Environment`s. They involve running `kustomize edit set image` on the
`env/prod` directory of our GitOps repository and committing those changes, then
forcing the `kargo-demo-prod` Argo CD `Application` to refresh and sync.

Because the corresponding `PromotionPolicy` resource does _not_ permit
auto-promotion, no `Promotion` resource will be automatically created.

After creating the `prod` `Environment` resource, we should almost immediately
see:

1. The `prod` `Environment` has not yet been assigned a current state:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment prod --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME   CURRENT STATE   HEALTH   AGE
   prod                            12s
   ```

1. The `prod` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the one
   available state, but shows no current state or history:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment prod \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. No `Promotion` resource was automatically created to transition the `prod`
   `Environment` into its one available state.

   ```shell
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```
   NAME                                                ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   stage-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   stage         d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   2m7s
   test-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686    test          d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   4m4s
   ```

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-prod`
   `Application` is _still_ not synced and healthy.

### Trigger a promotion to prod

In this step, we will trigger a promotion to transition the `prod` `Environment`
into a new state by manually creating a `Promotion` resource.

First, copy the ID of the `stage` `Environment`'s current state and assign it to
`STATE_ID` environment variable:

```shell
export STATE_ID=$(kubectl get environment stage -n kargo-demo -o jsonpath={.status.currentState.id})
```

Then apply the following:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promotion
metadata:
  name: prod-to-${STATE_ID}
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  environment: prod
  state: ${STATE_ID}
EOF
```

After a few moments, we should be able to see:

1. The `Promotion` has succeeded:

   ```shell
   kubectl get promotions --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME                                                ENVIRONMENT   STATE                                      PHASE       AGE
   stage-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   stage         d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   6m14ss
   test-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686    test          d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   8m11s
   prod-to-d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686    prod          d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Completed   12s
   ```

1. The `prod` `Environment` has now been assigned a current state:

   ```shell
   kubectl get environment prod --namespace kargo-demo
   ```

   ```text
   NAME   CURRENT STATE                              HEALTH    AGE
   prod   d9a3e3e54b11b3e4a763e7cb8b1098089b567686   Healthy   5m20s
   ```

1. The `prod` `Environment` resource's `status` field reflects the available
   state, the current state, and the history of all states this `Environment`
   has been in:

   ```text
   kubectl get environment prod \
     --namespace kargo-demo \
     --output jsonpath-as-json={.status}
   ```

1. [Your Argo CD dashboard](http://localhost:8080) shows that `kargo-demo-prod`
   `Application` is now not synced and healthy.

   Nginx running in the prod environment is visible at
   [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083).

## Summary

At this point, if a new semantically tagged version of the `nginx` image should
be pushed to Docker Hub, it will automatically be discovered and promoted into
our test environment, followed shortly thereafter by promotion into our stage
environment. Upon reaching the stage environment, it will become available for
manual promotion to production.

This has been a "hello world"-level introduction to Kargo, demonstrating only
the most basic functionality. Much more complex and useful promotion patterns
are also possible and you are invited to continue exploring the documentation
to learn more!

## Cleaning up

To clean up, we will simply destroy our kind or k3d cluster:

<Tabs groupId="cluster-start">
<TabItem value="kind" label="kind">

```shell
kind delete cluster --name kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d" label="k3d">

```shell
k3d cluster delete kargo-quickstart
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
