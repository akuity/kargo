# What is Kargo?

Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and application lifecycle
orchestration platform for Kubernetes. It builds upon
[GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) principles and integrates with existing
technologies, like [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/), to streamline and
automate the progressive rollout of changes across the many stages of an
application's lifecycle.

Kargo's goal is to provide an intuitive and flexible layer "above" existing GitOps tooling, wherein you can describe the relationships between various application instances deployed to different environments as well as procedures for progressing changes from one application instance's source of truth to the next.

:::caution
Kargo is undergoing active development and everyone is invited to [join us in the effort of getting Kargo to a GA release!](https://github.com/akuity/kargo) Expect breaking changes between pre-GA minor releases."
