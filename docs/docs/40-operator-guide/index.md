# Kargo Operator's Guide

The Kargo's Operator's Guide is for individuals responsible for the installation
and maintenance of Kargo. This entire branch of the documentation tree is
dedicated to topics such as installation, configuration, topology, and security
-- all from an operator's perspective.

:::note
It is not necessary to be responsible for a large-scale or long-lived
installation of Kargo to benefit from this Operator's Guide. Even if you are
only installing Kargo into a local Kubernetes cluster just to see what it's all
about, we count you as a part-time operator and believe you will find a wealth
of useful information in these pages.

to get started in the [Contributor Guide](../60-contributor-guide/index.md).
