# `copy`

`copy` copies files or the contents of entire directories from one specified
location to another.

## Configuration

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `inPath` | `string` | Y | Path to the file or directory to be copied. This path is relative to the temporary workspace that Kargo provisions for use by the promotion process. |
| `outPath` | `string` | Y | Path to the destination. This path is relative to the temporary workspace that Kargo provisions for use by the promotion process. |

## Examples

### Common Usage

The most common (though still advanced) usage of this step is to combine content
from two working trees to use as input to a subsequent step, such as one that
renders Stage-specific manifests.

Consider a Stage that requests Freight from two Warehouses, where one provides
Kustomize "base" configuration, while the other provides a Stage-specific
Kustomize overlay. Rendering the manifests intended for such a Stage will
require combining the base and overlay configurations:

```yaml
vars:
- name: gitRepo
  value: https://github.com/example/repo.git
steps:
- uses: git-clone
  config:
    repoURL: ${{ vars.gitRepo }}
    checkout:
    - commit: ${{ commitFrom(vars.gitRepo, warehouse("base")).ID }}
      path: ./src
    - commit: ${{ commitFrom(vars.gitRepo, warehouse(ctx.stage + "-overlay")).ID }}
      path: ./overlay
    - branch: stage/${{ ctx.stage }}
      create: true
      path: ./out
- uses: git-clear
  config:
    path: ./out
- uses: copy
  config:
    inPath: ./overlay/stages/${{ ctx.stage }}/kustomization.yaml
    outPath: ./src/stages/${{ ctx.stage }}/kustomization.yaml
# Render manifests to ./out, commit, push, etc...
```
