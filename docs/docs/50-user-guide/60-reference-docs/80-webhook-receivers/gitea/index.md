# The Gitea Webhook Receiver

The Gitea webhook receiver responds to `push` events originating from Gitea
repositories by _refreshing_ all `Warehouse` resources subscribed to those
repositories.

:::info
"Refreshing" a `Warehouse` resource means enqueuing it for immediate
reconciliation by the Kargo controller, which will execute the discovery of
new artifacts from all repositories to which that `Warehouse` subscribes.
:::

:::info
The Gitea webhook receiver also works with Gitea Enterprise and Gitea Cloud.
:::

## Configuring the Receiver

A Gitea webhook receiver must reference a Kubernetes `Secret` resource with a
`secret` key in its data map. This
[shared secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret) will be used by
Gitea to sign requests and by the receiver to verify those signatures.

:::note
The following commands are suggested for generating and base64-encoding a
complex secret:

```shell
secret=$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '=+/' | head -c 32)
echo "Secret: $secret"
echo "Encoded secret: $(echo -n $secret | base64)"
```
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: gitea-wh-secret
  namespace: kargo-demo
  labels:
    kargo.akuity.io/cred-type: generic
data:
  secret: <base64-encoded secret>
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProjectConfig
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  webhookReceivers: 
  - name: gitea-wh-receiver
    gitlab:
      secretRef:
        name: gitea-wh-secret
```

## Retrieving the Receiver's URL

Kargo will generate a hard-to-guess URL from the receiver's configuration. This
URL can be obtained using a command such as the following:

```shell
kubectl get projectconfigs kargo-demo \
  -n kargo-demo \
  -o=jsonpath='{.status.webhookReceivers}'
```

## Registering with Gitea

1. Navigate to the webhooks dashboard.

    Where you can find these settings varies based on the scope at which you'd
    like to enable your webhooks. Webhooks can be enabled for a single
    repository, for all repositories within an organization, or for all
    repositories belonging to an individual user.

    <Tabs groupId="navigation">
    <TabItem value="repo-scope" label="Repo Scope" default>

    Navigate to `https://gitea.com/<namespace>/<repo>/settings/hooks`, where
    `<namespace>` has been replaced with a Gitea username or group name and
    `<project>` has been replaced with the name of a project belonging to that
    namespace and for which you are an administrator.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="org-scope" label="Org Scope">

    Navigate to `https://gitea.com/org/<org>/settings/hooks`, where
    `<org>` has been replaced by a Gitea organization for which you are an
    administrator.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="user-scope" label="User Scope">

    Navigate to `https://gitea.com/org/user/settings/hooks`.
 
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    ![Webhooks Form](./img/form.png " Webhooks Form")

    1. Set the <Hlt>Target URL</Hlt> to the URL
       [for the webhook receiver](#retrieving-the-receivers-url).

    1. Set <Hlt>Secret</Hlt> to the value assigned to the `secret`
       key of the `Secret` referenced by the
       [webhook receiver's configuration](#configuring-the-receiver).

    1. In the <Hlt>Trigger On</Hlt> section, ensure <Hlt>Push Events</Hlt> is
       checked.

    1. Click <Hlt>Add Webhook</Hlt>.

       This will return you to the list of all webhooks registered at the
       selected scope.
