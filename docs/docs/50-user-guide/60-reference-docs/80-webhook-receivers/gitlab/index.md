# The GitLab Webhook Receiver

The GitLab Webhook Receiver responds to `push` events originating from GitLab
repositories by _refreshing_ all `Warehouse` resources subscribed to those
repositories.

:::info
"Refreshing" a `Warehouse` resource means enqueuing it for immediate
reconciliation by the Kargo controller, which will execute the discovery of
new artifacts from all repositories to which that `Warehouse` subscribes.
:::

:::info
The GitLab webhook receiver also works with GitLab Dedicated and GitLab
Self Managed, although some URLs in this document may need to be adjusted
accordingly.
:::

## Configuring the Receiver

A GitLab webhook receiver must reference a Kubernetes `Secret` resource with a
`secret-token` key in its data map. This
[shared secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret) will be used by
GitLab to sign requests any by the receiver to verify those signatures.

:::note
The following commands are suggested for generating and base64-encoding a
complex secret:

```shell
secret_token=$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '=+/' | head -c 32)
echo "Secret token: $secret_token"
echo "Encoded secret token: $(echo -n $secret_token | base64)"
```

:::

```yaml
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: gl-wh-secret
  namespace: kargo-demo
data:
  secret-token: <base64-encoded secret token>
---
apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProjectConfig
metadata:
  name: kargo-demo
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  webhookReceivers: 
    - name: gl-wh-receiver
      gitlab:
        secretRef:
          name: gl-wh-secret
```

## Retrieving the Receiver's URL

Kargo will generate a hard-to-guess URL from the receiver's configuration. This
URL can be obtained using a command such as the following:

```shell
kubectl get projectconfigs kargo-demo \
  -n kargo-demo \
  -o=jsonpath='{.status.webhookReceivers}'
```

## Registering with GitLab

To configure a single GitLab repository to notify a receiver of `push` events:

1. Navigate to `https://gitlab.com/<namespace>/<project>/-/hooks`, where
   `<namespace>` has been replaced with a GitLab username or group name and
   `<project>` has been replaced with the name of a project belonging to that
   namespace and for which you are an administrator.

    ![Settings](./img/settings.png "Settings")

1. Click <Hlt>Add new webhook</Hlt>.

1. Complete the <Hlt>Webhooks</Hlt> form:

    ![Webhooks Form](./img/add-webhook-form.png "Webhooks Form")

    1. Enter a descriptive name in the <Hlt>Name</Hlt> field.

    1. Complete the <Hlt>URL</Hlt> filed using the URL
       [for the webhook receiver](#retrieving-the-receivers-url).

    1. Complete the <Hlt>Secret token</Hlt> field using to the (unencoded) value
       assigned to the `secret-token` key of the `Secret` resource referenced by
       the
       [webhook receiver's configuration](#configuring-the-receiver).

    1. In the <Hlt>Trigger</Hlt> section, ensure <Hlt>Push events</Hlt> is
       selected.

    1. Click <Hlt>Add webhook</Hlt>.

1. From the <Hlt>Webhooks settings</Hlt> page, verify connectivity by expanding
   the <Hlt>Test</Hlt> dropdown menu next to your webhook and selecting
   <Hlt>Push events</Hlt>.

    ![Webhooks](./img/webhooks.png "Webhooks")

    ![Test Button](./img/test-button.png "Test Button")

    :::note
    This is safe to do because the test payload will lack the necessary
    details to successfully refresh `Warehouse` resources subscribed to the
    repository.
    :::

    If the test `push` event was delivered successfully, a success message will
    appear at the top of the <Hlt>Webhooks settings</Hlt> page.

    :::info
    If the test event is not successful, troubleshoot by clicking the
    <Hlt>Edit</Hlt> button next to your webhook, then scrolling down to the
    <Hlt>Recent events</Hlt> section to view details of the failed request.
