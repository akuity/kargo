# Configuring Event Routers

[Event Routers](./00-overview.md#event-routers) are used to route events to different destinations
based on specified criteria. This document provides guidance on how to configure and use Event
Routers in Kargo.

:::info

Before creating Event Routers, ensure that you or your administrator have set up the necessary
[`ClusterMessageChannel`](../../../../40-operator-guide/35-cluster-configuration.md#cluster-message-channels)
or [`MessageChannel`](../../../20-how-to-guides/20-working-with-projects.md#message-channels)
resources that define the destinations for your notifications.

:::

## Managing Event Routers

You can manage Event Routers through the Kargo UI or declaratively via YAML configuration files
deployed by Argo CD. To manage it in the UI, go to your Project settings, then in the sidebar,
select "Notifications." In this section you can create, update, and delete both your channels and
your event routers.

:::note

Currently, event routers can only be created by editing YAML, which you can do in the UI. We plan to
improve this experience in future releases.

:::

The simplest form of an event router configuration looks like this:

```yaml
kind: EventRouter
apiVersion: ee.kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: promotion-status
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  types:
    - PromotionFailed
    - PromotionErrored
  channels:
    - name: devops-team-slack
      kind: MessageChannel
```

In this example, the event router named `test-router` is configured to listen for two [event
types](../10-event-reference.md#event-types): `PromotionCreated` and `PromotionErrored`. When either
of these events occurs, a notification will be sent to the channel named `slack`, which is of kind
`MessageChannel` using a default message template defined for the type of event along with the
channel type. You can listen for multiple event types and send notifications to multiple channels by
adding more entries to the `types` and `channels` lists.

:::warning

If you're using default message templates, the specified event types _must_ all be of the same
"class" (such as Promotion events, Freight events, etc.). Mixing event types from different classes
is not supported when using default templates and will error.

:::

Additionally, you will likely want to make use of filters to control when notifications are sent.
This is done by setting the `when` field in the event router spec, which uses
[expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org/) expressions (see [the message formatting
docs](./20-message-formatting.md) for more information on available data). The expression must
resolve to a boolean value. For example, to only send notifications for promotions targeting a
specific stage, you could configure the event router like this:

```yaml
kind: EventRouter
apiVersion: ee.kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: prod-promotions
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  types:
    - PromotionCreated
    - PromotionErrored
  channels:
    - name: devops-team-slack
      kind: MessageChannel
  when: "event.stageName == 'production'"
```

<!-- NOTE: We should add a supademo of how to create an Event Router once the UI stabilizes a bit -->

## Advanced Configuration

The default templates and `when` field will likely cover many use cases, but you can also customize
the message content and formatting by specifying a custom message body. This allows you to tailor
the notifications to your specific needs. 

The top level fields for configuring a custom message body are:

- `output`: The main content of the message for all channels (unless overridden in channel-specific
  fields).
- `encodingType`: The format of the `output` field. Available options include plaintext (an empty
  string or omitted value), `json`, `yaml`, and `xml`.

The output can be customized using [`expr-lang`](https://expr-lang.org/) expressions to include
dynamic content based on the event data. These expressions must be enclosed in `${{ }}`. For
example, to include the stage name in the message, you could use `${{ event.stageName }}`. For
information on available data and formatting options, see the [message formatting
documentation](./20-message-formatting.md).

:::warning

If you are using the top level `output` field, in most cases the output should be a string as each
message type can generate a default message from the output in the proper format for that channel.
In other words, if you are sending to both SMTP and Slack, the structured data each would expect is
different so structured data will need to be provided for each channel type. However, if you are
sending to multiple channels of the same type (e.g., multiple Slack channels), you can provide a
common structured output that works for all of them.

:::

You can also specify channel-specific message bodies by providing `output` fields within the channel
configuration list. This allows you to customize the message content for each channel independently.
For example:

```yaml
kind: EventRouter
apiVersion: ee.kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: promotion-started
  namespace: kargo-demo
spec:
  types:
    - PromotionCreated
  channels:
    - name: slack
      kind: MessageChannel
      output: "Kargo has kicked off promotion to stage: ${{ event.stageName }}."
    - name: smtp
      kind: MessageChannel
      encodingType: yaml
      output: |
        subject: ðŸš€ Deployment Promotion Started
        to: email@example.com
        body: Kargo has kicked off promotion to stage: ${{ event.stageName }}.
```

documentation](./20-message-formatting.md).
