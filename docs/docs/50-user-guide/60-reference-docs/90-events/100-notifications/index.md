:::info

This set of features are only available in Kargo on the [Akuity
Platform](https://akuity.io/akuity-platform), versions v1.8 and above.

:::

Kargo's Notifications feature allows you to configure and send notifications based on specific
events that occur within your Kargo projects. This can be useful for keeping team members informed
about important actions, such as promotions, approvals, or failures. Notifications are event-driven,
meaning they are triggered by specific events rather than being part of a predefined workflow. For
sending a notification as part of a promotion workflow, consider using the [`send-message` promotion
step](../../30-promotion-steps/send-message.md).
