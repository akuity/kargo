# Kargo Event Reference

This document contains a complete reference of all Kargo events, including their types and
descriptions.

:::info

These events are always emitted by Kargo to the Kubernetes event log with the keys encoded in the
annotations of the event. However, they are primarily consumed by the Pro version of Kargo (such as
the [Notification feature](./100-notifications/index.md))

:::

## Event Fields

Many Kargo events share common fields. The following sections describe these common fields, which
are referenced in individual event definitions. Each field is given as it appears in the event
payload (serialized as JSON) and, if optional, notes whether the type is a pointer when used in
expr-lang expressions.

In each event definition in [Event Types](#event-types), the included fields are listed under
"Payload Includes" with references to the relevant sections. All of the fields described in those
events are found at the top level of the event payload unless otherwise noted.

### Common Event Fields

These fields are included in all Kargo events:
