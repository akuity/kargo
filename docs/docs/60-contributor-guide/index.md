# Kargo Contributor's Guide

This contributor guide is intended as a comprehensive introduction for
developers who are looking to get involved with contributing directly to the
Kargo project.

:::caution
Ideas and contributions from the community are always welcome, however, items
not appearing on the [roadmap](../100-roadmap.md) are reviewed on a best-effort
basis.

If you would like to contribute, please avoid wasted or duplicated effort by
discussing feature requests and design proposals with maintainers prior to
starting work. While we cannot guarantee specific timelines or outcomes, we
value and consider every submission.
