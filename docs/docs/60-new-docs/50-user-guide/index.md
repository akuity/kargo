# Kargo User's Guide

The Kargo User's Guide is for developers using Kargo to implement flexible and
powerful GitOps promotion pipelines. This entire branch of the documentation
tree is dedicated to topics such as managing Kargo projects, defining promotion
pipelines, and managing credentials and other secrets used by your pipelines --
all from an end-user's perspective.

__Not what you were looking for?__

If you're an operator responsible for the installation and maintenance of Kargo,
you'll find the most relevant topics to that role documented in the
[Operator Guide](../40-operator-guide/index.md). If you're primarily a developer
and need help installing Kargo into a local Kubernetes cluster just to see what
it's all about, the Operator Guide is still a great place to start.

If you're a developer interested in contributing to Kargo, you'll find
everything you need to get started in the
[Contributor Guide](../60-contributor-guide/index.md).
